00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,529
- it's always about money.
- [Morgan] Mmm.

167
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,155
Well, not this time.

168
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,910
I mean, thieves don't steal masterpieces
to hang on their walls, Ms. Gillory.

169
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,788
Maybe this one did, Mr. Eastman.

170
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,581
[Karadec] Morgan and I'll go see

171
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,458
what the Fosters
can tell us about their painting.

172
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,253
Great. Fill in Rhys on the way.

173
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,257
Shall we?

174
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,148
The moment we saw her at auction,
we knew we had to have her.

175
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,943
I mean... [chuckles] ...honestly,
we would have paid even more.

176
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,321
We think she's priceless.

177
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,033
Greg and I started a hedge fund
right out of college.

178
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,869
We worked 80 hours a week
for decades.

179
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,121
So by the time we even thought about kids,

180
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:03,125
we couldn't imagine chasing a baby
around here, making a mess.

181
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:07,379
So, we often thought of the girl
in that painting as our daughter.

182
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,590
Can you think of anyone
who may have wanted to steal from you?

183
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,301
[Greg] No. You think this was personal?

184
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,555
- So, why share her?
- I'm sorry, what?

185
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,141
Mmm. Oh, just you're talking about
this painting like your daughter,

186
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,143
and I've never put my daughter
in a museum.

187
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,187
I'm just wondering
why you wouldn't keep it to yourself.

188
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:27,149
Loaning out a masterpiece increases
its visibility and its reputation.

189
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,943
And its value. Spend some time
in a museum, jacks up the price.

190
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,278
You can sell it to the highest bidder.

191
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,655
- She's not for sale.
- Mmm.

192
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,324
[Rhys] Well, in my experience,
thieves are two things.

193
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,367
They're greedy and chatty.

194
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,452
And these masterpieces,

195
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:42,039
they don't fetch the same price on
the black market as they do at an auction.

196
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,124
So these thieves,
they like to talk to people.

197
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,920
They ask around and all it will take
is one of these people to call me

198
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,633
and I can help negotiate
the return of your lovely servant girl.

199
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,344
Do you call her a servant girl?

200
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,179
It's not a servant.

201
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,680
Excuse me?

202
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,142
She's leaning out the windowsill looking
for business. That's a working girl.

203
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,937
Well, there's speculation
that the subject was a courtesan,

204
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,314
but widely believed
that she was either a servant girl--

205
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,691
A servant girl with a gold braid?
Come on. [chuckles]

206
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,486
Look at the way she leans.
It's domestic, not provocative.

207
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:16,490
It's upsetting, is what it is, because
she looks like a child, but she's working.

208
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,117
She's contemplating life.

209
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,994
- I-Is this important to the investigation?
- No, it's not.

210
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,413
What else can you tell us
about the Rembrandt itself?

211
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:27,418
The details about her providence,
they're all in here.

212
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,637
This girl in the window's traveled
all over the world.

213
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:42,766
Paris, London, Berlin. She's lived
a much more exciting life than me.

214
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,185
Except now she's probably rolled up
in the back of somebody's van.

215
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:49,107
Well, let's hope she got it all
out of her system first.

216
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,359
- This is interesting.
- You got something?

217
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,532
Maybe. Right after Rembrandt painted
the young girl in 1645, he sold it.

218
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,201
At that point, it sort of bounced around
for a few 100 years,

219
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,704
17th century Paris,
kind of skimmed this part,

220
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:07,291
until it was purchased by a Prussian
nobleman who kept it until he died.

221
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,168
[coughs]

222
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,211
Then his family kept it till 1932

223
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,631
until Franz von Papen
dissolved the Free State of Prussia.

224
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,216
I thought you said this was interesting.

225
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,135
Look, I'm trying to care
about this case, okay?

226
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:22,055
Which at the moment is just saving an
insurance company from having to pay money

227
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,683
to a couple of people
who seem to be doing just fine.

228
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,893
Where did she go next?

229
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:31,064
To a Polish businessman in Kraków,
and he hung it in his family home.

230
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,359
Then it just kind of bounced around
from collection to collection

231
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,654
until good old Greg
and Linda paid a fortune for it.

232
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,032
Why is any of this important?

233
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,824
I don't know yet.

234
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,785
Lab results came back on those slags
we found on the museum floor,

235
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,080
tested positive for aluminum oxide,
so I did some research.

236
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,458
<i>When aluminum combines with ferric oxide,</i>

237
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,169
<i>it creates a thermite reaction
hot enough to melt glass.</i>

238
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,838
[Karadec] <i>That would explain why we didn't
find any glass shards under the sky light.</i>

239
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,132
It also came up in a report
on another museum heist.

240
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,552
Two years ago, a Matisse was stolen
from the Kunsthal Museum in Rotterdam.

241
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,430
<i>And aluminum oxide was found
under the museum sky light.</i>

242
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,724
Which might mean
this isn't our thief's first rodeo.

243
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,351
You and Daphne look for others.

244
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,979
So far we found 19 heists around the world
with the same MO.

245
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,733
Always a masterpiece stolen from
a gallery. Always worth 10 to 30 million.

246
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,985
And traces of aluminum oxide
at every scene

247
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,613
under a window
or a skylight just like ours.

248
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,989
We have any idea who it might be?

249
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,409
Well, the internet seems to think so.
Some call him Jean-Baptiste.

250
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,871
- He's French?
- No, but the first painting he stole was.

251
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,165
"<i>The White Duck</i> by Jean-Baptiste Oudrey."

252
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,751
Stolen in Paris, 12 years ago.

253
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,211
Tell me somebody's got eyes on him.

254
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,380
Only once.

255
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,632
[Karadec] He tried to steal a Picasso
in Madrid five years ago,

256
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,468
but a guard shot him in the left shoulder,
and he fled empty handed.

257
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,264
- Okay, so why can't anybody find this guy?
- [Rhys] Because he might not exist.

258
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,682
- He could be a myth.
- What do you mean?

259
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,058
I mean, it's impressive work,

260
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,978
but the name Jean-Baptiste comes up
whenever there's a heist unsolved,

261
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,439
the thief got in and out without a trace,
escaped with another masterpiece.

262
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,732
Must be Jean-Baptiste.

263
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:59,278
But is he real? Maybe.
It could be ten different guys.

264
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,947
Check this out. I searched public records.

265
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,658
Someone sued claiming
to be the Rembrandt's rightful owner.

266
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:05,742
We have a name?

267
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,036
Yeah, an Ari Weisman,
but it looks like the records are sealed.

268
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,622
Ari would be the first guy to take matters
into his own hands

269
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,749
- when the court ruled against him.
- [Nick] We got an address?

270
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,544
Yeah, looks like he's local.

271
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:18,423
Captain, I could use a hand from
Detectives Ozdil and Forrester for a bit.

272
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,466
Is this about that cold case?

273
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:23,761
It is.

274
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,056
You heard the lieutenant?

275
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,142
Can I help with anything?

276
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,186
No, I'm good. I'll keep you posted.

277
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,732
Why don't you guys go find out
if this Ari Weisman responds

278
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,276
to the name Jean-Baptiste?

279
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,243
[Ari] We just wanted the painting back.

280
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,328
How badly?

281
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,123
Enough to sue, not steal.

282
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,709
Sorry, you think
that painting belonged to you?

283
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,712
Not me, my grandma.

284
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:02,300
My father bought that painting in 1932.

285
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:07,512
I remember the day he hang it up
on the wall.

286
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:13,019
<i>Whenever we all got together,
there was the girl smiling down to us.</i>

287
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,438
Always felt she felt
like part of the family.

288
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,815
- [chuckles]
- [Rhys] Your father had wonderful taste.

289
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,109
It's a very special piece.

290
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,569
One of my favorites.

291
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,155
We lived in Kraków.

292
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:30,995
My father, my mother, and my two brothers,
Jacob and Samuel.

293
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,164
I was the youngest.

294
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,463
The only one in our family that survived.

295
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,717
When the Nazis came...

296
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,304
they took everything.

297
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,145
I'm so sorry.

298
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,148
We're still here.

299
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,653
I'm guessing you searched
the auction catalogs for years.

300
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,448
I thought she'd never find it, and
then one day there it was, up for sale.

301
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:13,121
The owners.
They wanted to sell it to us. [grunts]

302
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,456
For $20 million.

303
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,418
We don't have $20 million.

304
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,421
The court said
we couldn't prove it was stolen.

305
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,924
Is that all?

306
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,515
Actually, Ari, we have to ask,
where were you last night?

307
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,269
I was here with my grandma.

308
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,397
I saw your name
on the museum visitor logs.

309
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,399
You were there a couple of days ago.

310
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,152
I wanted to take a photo to show to her.

311
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,362
Have you traveled
outside the country the last few years?

312
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,531
No.

313
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,491
No, but she keeps asking me
to take her to Poland.

314
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,327
She wants to visit
the house where she grew up.

315
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,872
She's not doing much traveling now.

316
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,083
That painting was the closest
she'll come to going home.

317
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,627
Please.

318
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,630
Thank you.

319
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,558
[Selena] Thanks for the assist, you guys.

320
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,187
Once every item is tagged, photographed,
and packaged for forensics--

321
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,856
I'll get TID to get started
on data extraction on his phone.

322
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,358
Hopefully, we uncover
text messages, call logs.

323
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,985
You want fiber analysis on the backpack?

324
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,612
All of it. I want the works.

325
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,156
This much activity,
people gonna start asking questions.

326
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,450
What are we saying
if the captain asks what we're doing?

327
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,827
Tell him to talk to me.

328
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,413
And let's run this stack of photos
through facial recognition.

329
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,498
Okay.

330
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,796
Okay, let's go over it one last time.

331
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,424
- Mom, I got it. Trust me.
- I do trust you.

332
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,469
That's why I'm paying you a premium
instead of hiring a babysitter.

333
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,930
You've literally rejected
every babysitter in California.

334
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,182
And I wouldn't say
you're paying me a premium.

335
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:00,727
It is a perfectly reasonable wage
based on current market conditions.

336
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,147
Listen, Chloe's routine has changed
since she's down a nap.

337
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,440
So can you just indulge me?

338
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,275
[sighs] Nap time from one to three.

339
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,777
Classical music on low.

340
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,363
For lunch, she gets half a grilled cheese
and mushed up zucchini.

341
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,907
After that, she can play with her blocks,
and if she gets frustrated,

342
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,992
then distract her
with the singing giraffe.

343
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,661
- I wanna be very clear about something.
- Hmm.

344
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,914
She's gonna get frustrated
and she will throw those blocks.

345
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,792
- I'll be prepared.
- Okay, perfect.

346
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,876
Oh, wait, Mom. Hold on a sec.

347
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,961
Can this wait? I got to go.

348
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,170
I know,

349
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,131
but I just wanted to know what the cops
are doing with Dad's stuff from his bag.

350
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,009
Did they find anything yet? [scoffs]

351
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,761
These things take time.

352
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,055
I know, but can't you push them
to make it go faster?

353
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,474
- Can't you be patient, please?
- [sighs]

354
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,518
Listen, there's a reason
I gave his stuff to them, okay?

355
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,019
They're gonna find something
and when they do,

356
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,104
I'll let you know, I promise.

357
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,856
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.

358
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,318
Also, I'm pretty sure that singing giraffe
is broken, so best of luck to you. Bye.

359
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,446
- Is it really? No, Mom.
- Love you.

360
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,614
[sighs]

361
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,117
And what is your job at the museum?

362
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,577
I'm a gallery attendant.

363
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,496
I've been the assistant curator
at The Harbach for almost twenty years.

364
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,956
I just collect tickets and the paycheck.

365
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,333
I don't know anything
about that painting getting stolen.

366
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,669
Did you notice anything
out of the ordinary the past few weeks?

367
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,296
Maybe a visitor lingering around.

368
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,381
Mmm. One sneezed on a Vermeer last week,

369
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:16,387
so I showed him Caravaggio's
<i>Judith Beheading Holofernes</i> as a warning.

370
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,098
How'd you get that bruise on your face?

371
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,891
Took a nap on the floor.

372
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,643
Hmm.

373
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,812
Are you sure you haven't seen
anything out of the ordinary?

374
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,773
I noticed a guy hanging
around the Rembrandt a few days ago.

375
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,192
He looked familiar,
like I'd see him a few times,

376
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,236
but I mean, we see a lot of faces.

377
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,238
Do you remember anything
specific about him?

378
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,617
I remember thinking,
he looked like he went for a run.

379
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,457
Yeah, that's him.

380
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,710
[footsteps approaching]

381
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,004
Oh, come on.

382
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,464
We have to consider Ari a suspect.

383
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,884
He has means, motive, and his alibi wants
the Rembrandt just as much as he does.

384
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,012
Yeah, because the painting
belongs to her. Am I right?

385
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,763
I don't disagree, but--

386
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,139
No, but nothing.

387
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,976
Listen, the Weismans are
the victims here, not the suspects.

388
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,229
Are you picturing Miriam Weisman
rappelling through a skylight?

389
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,066
Well, Ari's a gymnast.
I can totally picture him doing it.

390
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:14,444
Look, all the museum employees
that we've talked to so far have alibis.

391
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,987
Morgan, what are you doing?

392
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,989
I am fixing our crime board

393
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,575
and correcting the timeline to include

394
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,369
the first time
that the painting was stolen.

395
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,453
In 1939.

396
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,790
Well, why confine ourselves
to solving crimes in the 21st century?

397
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,500
If we find <i>The Young Girl</i>,

398
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,293
we should be returning it
to Miriam Weisman,

399
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,462
- not the Fosters.
- [phone buzzes]

400
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,547
I got to take this.

401
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,132
Morgan, it's not that simple.

402
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,718
I don't know what to tell you.
There's gotta be something we can do.

403
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,471
Well, even if we had the jurisdiction
to resolve a crime from 80 years ago,

404
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,391
it's just not how the system works.

405
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,393
I really wish there was more we could do.

406
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,817
[Karadec sighs]

407
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,664
Who was that?

408
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,248
Excuse me?

409
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,375
Who was that?

410
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,460
You said that thieves love
to talk to people

411
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,129
and sometimes those people call you.

412
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,423
Was that people calling?

413
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,258
A man called.

414
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,846
Claims he knows where the painting is.
He wants to meet with me to discuss.

415
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,557
Where?

416
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,392
- [scoffs]
- You don't wanna tell me

417
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,978
'cause you're worried if the police
get involved, they're gonna ruin it?

418
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:33,899
If we spook whoever this guy is,
we may never recover the painting.

419
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,779
- Fine, then I'm coming with you.
- I can't show up with the cops.

420
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,282
I don't see any cops, do you?

421
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,624
Where is this guy?

422
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,876
He's late.

423
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,503
And why exactly is he calling you?

424
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,548
Well, not to sound insufferable, but
I'm the only person that does what I do.

425
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,883
[chuckles]

426
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,926
Sorry, you were trying
to not sound insufferable?

427
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,555
Well, from what I gather, you're the only
person that does what you do too.

428
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,266
It's a little different, but sure.

429
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,353
[Rhys sighs]
Well, I think we have some time to spare.

430
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,022
Let's see how this guy got in.

431
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,776
- Knock yourself out.
- Come on, you're coming with me.

432
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,570
I need your insufferable talents
on that roof.

If I could just... Hello.

436
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,211
Lieutenant, you got a second?

437
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,296
Good news only.

438
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,214
Well, TID is backed up.

too many phones, not enough texts.

00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,345
Remind her of the parking ticket
I got her mother out of

442
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,930
in front of the Van Nuys courthouse.

443
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,015
She owes me.

444
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,391
You know the difference
between good news and bad?

445
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,727
I ran those photos in the backpack
through facial recognition.

446
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,854
No criminal record
on the ones we could match

447
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,773
parking tickets, traffic stops,
nothing major.

448
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,818
- And the ones we couldn't match?
- Only one.

449
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,950
All right, I'll take it from here.

[♪ upbeat music playing]

451

Did you know there's
a German diaper derby competition?

452
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,216
It's held annually in Bavaria.

453

- I do well.
- Is Chloe napping or not?

456
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,853
Yes, which brings me to my next point.

457
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:38,606
Since I'm helping you babysit
and not being babysat...

458

I'll give you 10% of my pay.

Fine, 20%.

460
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,243
Deal.

00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,161
And I won't tell Mom
you're going through her clothes.

00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,455
How generous of you.

463

What if we promise not to touch anything?

[Rhys] Have you ever stolen anything?

466
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,445
Nothing with a provenance, you?

467
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,656
Yes, stole a classmate's trainers
once in primary school.

468
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:31,117
- Scotland Yard know about this?
- [chuckles]

469

He deserved it.

Used to kick this kid, Gideon,
in the shins with those shoes at recess.

471

Well, did you wear them to school?

472
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:41,794
No, I donated them to a thrift store
right by the bus stop.

473
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,881
That way he could see them
every time he looked through the window.

These skylights all have
a one-way window film on them.

The thief wouldn't be able to see in.

478

not knowing who's down there.

Yeah, why?

One of my docents found this at the front.

They didn't see who left it.

Know about what, sir?

Are you trying to sabotage

how you feel about this case.

No, I'm not trying to sabotage anything,
okay? I was trying to help.

He was going anyway. Would you prefer
I just let him go by himself?

497
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,829
Neither of you should've been there
in the first place.

498
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,706
Okay, I understand that. And I'm sorry.

499
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,666
But if we didn't,
we wouldn't have gotten this.

500
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,502
Whoever left this wants
to meet at 1:00 p.m.

501
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,215
That gives us less than 2 hours.

502
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,633
Are Forrester and Ozdil still
with the lieutenant?

503
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,218
You thinking a surveillance up?

504
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,178
Yes, and we need to see
the museum's security cameras.

505
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,347
Maybe we can get eyes
on whoever dropped this off.

506
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,349
Don't you think that Rhys should take
the lead on this though?

507
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,144
- And why would we do that?
- Because I'm who they want to speak to.

508
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:24,605
Great idea. I'll send Morgan with you
and you can tamper with more evidence.

509
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,690
Hey, I'm sorry, okay?

510
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,443
I'm sorry I went to a building
without your permission first.

511
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,904
- I see now that that was a bad idea.
- Bad idea?

512
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,075
How about reckless and insubordinate?

513
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,493
I just said I'm sorry.

514
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,538
I know that you don't like rules,
but when you're in my precinct,

515
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,958
I expect you to follow my command.

516
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,295
You practice that in a mirror?

517
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,050
- Morgan, calm--
- Do not tell me to calm down.

518
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,927
We need to grab someone from the SIS.

519
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,096
The sooner that we get
to the ransom's location,

520
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,765
the sooner that we can start surveillance.

521
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,517
- Okay, great. Rhys and I will follow you.
- No.

522
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,853
Detective Karadec and I can handle it
from here.

523
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,730
Our consultants have done enough.

524
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,233
- Are you kicking me off the case?
- [phone vibrates]

525
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,818
I walked up on a roof!

526
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,988
Oh, great. The Fosters
are on their way up. They want an update.

527
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,574
Talk to them. I'll be waiting downstairs.
Just make it quick.

528
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,993
What is going on?

529
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,953
Morgan, what were you thinking?

530
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,039
I get it!

531
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,878
This is why I work alone.

532
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,425
Do you drink alone?

533
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,804
- I prefer to have company.
- Great.

534
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,348
Good luck.

535
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,439
You believe that guy?

536
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,567
Kicking me off the case
so he can go follow a lead that we found.

537
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,737
He knows how I work. I do my thing
and then cases get solved, right?

538
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,072
What's wrong with that?

539
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,866
Nothing's wrong with that, Rhys.
That's the answer to that question.

540
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,201
You have every right to be upset.

541
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,829
Yeah, I know I do
because he called me out like I'm a child.

542
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,040
I have kids,
I don't even talk to them like that.

543
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:08,669
What?

544
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,088
Boys, girls, mix?

545
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,506
Mix. Don't change the subject.
I gotta get this out.

546
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,882
And why are we still driving?

547
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,344
Shouldn't we be
eating and drinking by now?

548
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,304
Are you suggesting I go faster?

549
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,348
Look at the car you're driving.
We just got passed by a Subaru.

550
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,934
You should be ashamed of yourself.

551
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,022
Where did you get this?

552
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,566
Our consultants came across it.

553
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,609
Good news is your painting
doesn't appear to be damaged.

554
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,862
What happens now?

555
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,946
We're supposed to pay the ransom?

556
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,364
That's not what I said, sir.

557
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,950
The LAPD never pays ransom.
We don't suggest that you do either.

558
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,369
I don't believe this.
So what do you suggest that we do?

559
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,288
Are we just gonna sit here and do nothing?

560
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,456
Detective, we have been waiting
by the phone,

561
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,917
and we have heard nothing, and now this?

562
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,212
Who sent you this?
Do you have any leads? Anything?

563
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,132
We're assembling a team to follow
that lead and recover your painting.

564
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:59,719
And how long does it take
to assemble this team of yours?

565
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,721
They're assembling
in the war room right now,

566
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,307
and I should be with them instead of here.

567
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:07,518
Detective, we just want her back.

568
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,478
I understand, sir.
Let us handle the response.

569
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,565
We'll get back to you
when we find out more.

570
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,735
Thank you
for keeping us informed, Detective.

571
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:16,987
Of course.

572
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,657
- Just a little bit more.
- Yes, sir.

573
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,868
- [phone buzzing]
- Thanks, bro.

574
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:29,165
<i>- This is Arthur.</i>
- Hi, this is Ava Sinquerra.

575
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,416
Boss, you want us to--

576
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,085
[Ava] <i>Hello?</i>

577
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,379
Um...

578
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,758
I just wanted to call you because there's
something I didn't get an answer to

579
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,093
at the diner 'cause my mom flipped out.
[chuckles]

580
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,346
Well, how does your mom feel
about you calling me?

581
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,598
<i>Oh, this call never happened.</i> [chuckles]

582
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,602
Actually, I should probably tell her
so she won't ground me again.

583
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,937
<i>Yeah, well, it sounds like a wise move.</i>

584
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:53,773
Look, Ava, I'm in the middle of working
right now, so--

585
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,151
You said that I reminded you of my dad?

586
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,156
What was he like?

587
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:04,451
[sighs]

588
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,745
Hello?

589
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,792
Look, I won't bother you again.
I promise. I just...

590
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:17,296
I'm sorry. Maybe this wasn't such
a good idea. I'll just leave you alone.

591
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,092
No, no, just hold on a second.

592
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,344
If you wanna have a serious talk
about your dad,

593
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,180
then we have to do it the right way.

594
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,892
I don't know, maybe me, you,
and your mom, we could...

595
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:33,146
<i>I don't know. Find ourselves back
at that diner at some point.</i>

596
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,147
<i>How does that sound to you?</i>

597
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,775
Sure, yeah.

598
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,237
Listen, Ava, until that happens,
you and I, we can't...

599
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,572
[sighs]

600
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,996
Look, Roman didn't always do things
the easy way,

601
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,373
<i>but he always did things the right way.</i>

602
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:55,001
I mean, he had a lot to do with me
getting my life together

603
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:58,422
and believe me,
he saved my ass more than once.

604
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,970
He's a stand-up guy through and through.

605
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,057
Well, look, Ava,
I gotta get back to work here.

606
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,852
- Hey, Arthur.
- Yeah.

607
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:15,147
Thank you.

608
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,691
Of course, sweetheart.

609
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,836
Everything all right, Detective?
Something on your mind?

610
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:44,300
You know, I read somewhere carrying
around unexpressed frustrations is like

611
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,843
carrying a heavy backpack.

612
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,847
Every unspoken thought adds
another stone to the load,

613
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,933
making your journey much more difficult.

614
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,394
- She's confused, sir.
- Hmm.

615
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,480
Yeah, so am I.

616
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,231
You're confused?

617
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,611
Sir, is there something you wanna tell me?

618
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,450
I can't protect you
if I don't know where you are.

619
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,162
I have to be in a position to help
if things go south.

620
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,123
I need to know everything,

621
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,210
and that's not because I don't trust her,

622
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,712
but because I do.

623
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,509
Still confused?

624
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,134
No.

625
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:32,766
Good. Because the same applies
to you and everyone else. You understand?

626
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,519
Yes, sir.

627
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,981
Next time you lose your cool with her.
I'd suggest you find a different approach.

628
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,733
Oh, yeah. Why is that?

629
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,486
Because if you don't,
it's gonna put me and you in a position

630
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,239
where things will definitely go south.

631
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,966
All clear.

632
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,099
Just getting a little impatient.

633
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,934
Don't worry.
The ransomer will turn up soon.

634
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,103
With you, Detective.

635
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,188
Impatient with me. Why?

636
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,692
We're sitting here nice and quiet.
Nothing but time for you to read me in.

637
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,069
Read you in on what?

638
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,198
Roman Sinquerra.

639
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,203
Come on, Adam.

640
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,831
You don't think I see things?

641
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,085
What do you wanna know?

642
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:44,921
[alarm blaring]

643
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:49,718
Oh. We don't have time for this.
It'll blow our cover.

644
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,053
Or spook our ransomer.

645
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,348
[Nick] We're here for the painting,
not some car thief.

646
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,392
Leave it alone.

647
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,394
He's committing a crime. I...

648
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,021
I'll handle this.

649
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,480
Detective.

650
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,609
Hey! Hey, man, that's my car.

651
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,237
What are you doing?
Bro, get out of my car now.

652
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,282
Whoa! LAPD, put the gun down.

653
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:17,621
Now. At your feet. Let's go.
Put that gun down now.

654
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,667
Drop it. On the ground.

655
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,130
Good. Keep your hands
where I can see 'em, son.

656
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,798
[tires screeching]

657
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,760
Hey, that's our guy. Let's go!

658
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,481
Hey! Hey!

659
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,942
Move!

660
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,614
- Wait, so now you're stealing the car.
- That's right. It's your lucky day.

661
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:03,750
[siren wailing]

662
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,004
[phone buzzing]

663
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,548
- Detective.
