1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,628
You know there's always some growing
pains when a new person joins a team.

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,966
I remember nothing but
absolute delight when I came on board.

3
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:12,512
You may have heard that I was
up for the captain's chair.

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,679
Turns out you're stuck with me.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,139
Nick Wagner. Your new captain.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,475
<i>Why are you being so cool,
right now? I hate this.</i>

7
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,101
<i>I'm pissed.
It should have been me.</i>

8
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,730
Root beer on an unprotected lip?
You're a madman.

9
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:23,731
The stress is getting to her.

10
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,859
She goes rogue and something happens...
She's not a cop.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,944
<i>You okay?</i>

12
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,904
<i>I told you it was a clean shot.
IA will clear me.</i>

13
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,156
I'm not worried about your badge.
I'm worried about you.

14
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,826
I just heard some rumors
you don't respond positively to authority.

15
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,579
Sometimes I forget what it's
like to have somebody looking out for me.

16
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,872
See you tomorrow, Gillory.

17
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,541
- <i>Hey, any news?
- We found Roman.</i>

18
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,376
- <i>I'm sending you a photo now.
- That's not Roman.</i>

19
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:47,421
Roman asked me to put eyes on you and Ava,
just to make sure you two were okay.

20
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,007
<i>Actually let myself believe
that he didn't abandon us.</i>

21
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,467
I still believe that.

22
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,551
<i>Arthur, I want that backpack.</i>

23
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,345
So, you think that
whatever's in that bag

24
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,099
will give you answers
and not just more questions?

25
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,335
Huh. That's weird. You see that?

26
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,421
Hmm.

27
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,422
It's not coming back.

28
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,507
I'ma go check it out.

29
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,718

00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,056

45
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:53,172
- Good morning.
- Morgan, hey, hey. Are you and Ava okay?

46
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,632
Yeah, we're good. What's up?

47
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,551
I'ma ask you straight up.
You have somebody following me again?

48
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,261
What? No. What are you talking about?

49
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,806
I don't know. I think someone's been
on my tail the past few days.

50
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,432
Maybe it's nothing.

51
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,769
Arthur, if you feel like you might be
in danger, you should call the police.

52
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,604
<i>No, I don't think that's a good idea.</i>

53
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,690
<i>Roman wasn't too keen
on the cops, remember?</i>

54
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,024
What does this have to do with Roman?

55
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,818
That's what I'm trying to figure out here.

56
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,027
I mean...

57
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,407
Were you able to learn anything about
what was inside that backpack of his?

58
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,036
No, not yet.

59
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,415
All right, well, look, maybe
you should just hide the bag for now,

60
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:31,460
'cause whoever Roman's running from might
not want what's inside getting out.

61
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,671
You hear me?

62
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,215
Yeah. Hey, I gotta go, okay.

63
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:40,428
All right, well, look,
just be careful, all right, you and Ava.

64
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,638
<i>Keep your head on a swivel.</i>

65
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,640
You too.

66
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,564
Ava and I didn't glove up at home.
Is that gonna be a problem?

67
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,692
Only if you think you two might be
suspects in Roman's disappearance.

68
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,860
I think you can count us out.

69
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,570
And nothing in the bag look familiar?

70
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,280
- Rang any bells?
- No.

71
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,282
Also, Roman's not a huge fan
of law enforcement,

72
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,867
so if we could just keep this between us.

73
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,827
We'll keep the circle small.

74
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:05,954
Thank you.

75
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,417
What's going on?

76
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,670
Just revisiting an old case.

77
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,967
Call came in pretty high profile.
I want these two on it.

78
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,927
Go, I got this.

79
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,805
And close the door.

80
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,565
She only arrived here last week.

81
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,649
She have a name?

82
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,276
<i>Young Girl Leaning On A Windowsill</i>.

83
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,904
You guys are saying she a lot.
We are talking about a painting, right?

84
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,156
Painted by Rembrandt in 1645.

85
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,075
Up until last night, she was here
with our other Dutch masters.

86
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:50,122
"This intimate portrait captures the most
fleeting moments of human expression."

87
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,207
Sorry, I missed it.

88
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,793
We'll need a list of museum employees,
anyone with access.

89
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,254
Of course. Then I should call the Fosters,
so they hear it from me.

90
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,672
The Fosters?

91
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,466
Linda and Greg Foster
loaned us the Rembrandt.

92
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,967
Any idea how much it's worth?

93
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:06,431
I believe they paid over 20 million
at auction a few years ago.

94
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,725
- I'll get you that list.
- Thank you.

95
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,645
Uh,
we are Major Crimes, right?

96
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,855
I'm not really seeing
what's major about this.

97
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,149
A theft of major artwork carries
a penalty of up to 10 years

98
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,486
before the DA attacks on possession,
conspiracy, breaking and entering.

99
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,987
Why? You prefer a dead body?

100
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,782
No, I've just seen actual missing girls
get less attention.

101
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,535
Well, like it or not, every news outlet's
gonna run with this story tonight.

102
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,620
The captain's probably trying to keep
this thing from blowing up in our faces.

103
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,957
One guard said there was too much smoke
for her to get a look at the thief.

104
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,001
Second guard took a blow to the head,
but I hear should be okay.

105
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,378
So this is our point of entry?

106
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,463
Yeah, and exit
as far as we can tell.

107
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,217
We had whatever this is
sent over to the lab for testing.

108
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,593
Well, put a rush on the results
and see if we can get a log

109
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,221
- of visitors the past few weeks.
- Okay.

110
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,101
So the thief entered here, but
the Rembrandt's all the way over there.

111
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,228
Most thieves prefer not to bust
through the wall like the Kool-Aid Man.

112
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:58,607
Okay, so this person took
the time to cut out the window,

113
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,569
<i>toss down a rope, slide down right here.</i>

114
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:08,075
And then just walks right by Vermeer,
Caravaggio, Turner, Rubens, Delacroix,

115
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:12,204
and Goya? Do you have any idea
how much all of those are worth?

116
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,622
I'm sure you're going to tell me.

117
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,457
A lot more than the Rembrandt.

118
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,959
If this heist was about money,

119
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,254
the thief would have taken
the most valuable piece he could.

120
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,677
<i>Our guy would have known
that this Goya was the real jackpot.</i>

121
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,096
Maybe they didn't do their research.

122
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,140
Every single detail
of this thing was planned.

123
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:35,019
I mean, look at the frame, that perfectly
straight line down the inside seam.

124
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,605
Removing this canvas
took precision and time.

125
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,648
Somebody wanted this painting
for a reason.

126
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,276
Whoever the thief was,
they were not in it for the money.

127
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,862
This was personal.

128
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,864
They wanted her.

129
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,410
Did you say 22 million?

130
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,954
Yeah, but if Morgan's right, we need
to find out more about the Rembrandt

131
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,417
to figure out who might have taken it.
And what their real motivation was.

132
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,386
Excuse me.

133
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,679
Is this Major Crimes?

134
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,974
You must be Mr. Eastman.
I'm Captain Wagner, we spoke on the phone.

135
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,809
Of course, please, call me Rhys.

136
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,897
Rhys flew in from Mexico City this morning
to help us find our missing girl.

137
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:23,652
Yeah, I had a lead on Kahlo's
<i>La Mesa Herida</i>, but... it didn't pan out.

138
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,653
Uh, help us how?

139
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:30,032
I'm an art recovery specialist.
I recover lost, missing, or stolen art.

140
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,409
They cram all the info right there
in the title, huh? That's helpful.

141
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,037
- And you are?
- Gillory works with us as a consultant.

142
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,540
She does, and she really feels as
though this painting has enough attention

143
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,792
without flying someone in.

144
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,418
Did the Fosters send you?

145
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,880
No, the insurance company did.
If I can recover the Rembrandt safely,

146
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,841
the insurance company
can avoid cutting a rather large check.

147
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,719
Oh, good, good. What a relief.

148
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,682
Okay, so this entire investigation is
about saving an insurance company money.

149
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:58,435
That's awesome, right guys? Just wanted
to make sure you guys heard that. Go on.

150
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,771
Morgan believes that the Fosters'
Rembrandt was targeted

151
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,481
for a reason other than money.

152
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,443
I mean, anything's possible,
but in my experience,

153
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,529
- it's always about money.
- Mmm.

154
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,155
Well, not this time.

155
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,910
I mean, thieves don't steal masterpieces
to hang on their walls, Ms. Gillory.

156
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,788
Maybe this one did, Mr. Eastman.

157
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,581
Morgan and I'll go see

158
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,458
what the Fosters
can tell us about their painting.

159
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,253
Great. Fill in Rhys on the way.

160
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,257
Shall we?

161
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,148
The moment we saw her at auction,
we knew we had to have her.

162
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,943
I mean... ...honestly,
we would have paid even more.

163
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,321
We think she's priceless.

164
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,033
Greg and I started a hedge fund
right out of college.

165
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,869
We worked 80 hours a week
for decades.

166
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,121
So by the time we even thought about kids,

167
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:03,125
we couldn't imagine chasing a baby
around here, making a mess.

168
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:07,379
So, we often thought of the girl
in that painting as our daughter.

169
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,590
Can you think of anyone
who may have wanted to steal from you?

170
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,301
No. You think this was personal?

171
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,555
- So, why share her?
- I'm sorry, what?

172
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,141
Mmm. Oh, just you're talking about
this painting like your daughter,

173
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,143
and I've never put my daughter
in a museum.

174
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,187
I'm just wondering
why you wouldn't keep it to yourself.

175
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:27,149
Loaning out a masterpiece increases
its visibility and its reputation.

176
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,943
And its value. Spend some time
in a museum, jacks up the price.

177
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,278
You can sell it to the highest bidder.

178
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,655
- She's not for sale.
- Mmm.

179
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,324
Well, in my experience,
thieves are two things.

180
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,367
They're greedy and chatty.

181
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,452
And these masterpieces,

182
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:42,039
they don't fetch the same price on
the black market as they do at an auction.

183
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,124
So these thieves,
they like to talk to people.

184
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,920
They ask around and all it will take
is one of these people to call me

185
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,633
and I can help negotiate
the return of your lovely servant girl.

186
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,344
Do you call her a servant girl?

187
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,179
It's not a servant.

188
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,680
Excuse me?

189
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,142
She's leaning out the windowsill looking
for business. That's a working girl.

190
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,937
Well, there's speculation
that the subject was a courtesan,

191
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,314
but widely believed
that she was either a servant girl--

192
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,691
A servant girl with a gold braid?
Come on.

193
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,486
Look at the way she leans.
It's domestic, not provocative.

194
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:16,490
It's upsetting, is what it is, because
she looks like a child, but she's working.

195
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,117
She's contemplating life.

196
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,994
- I-Is this important to the investigation?
- No, it's not.

197
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,413
What else can you tell us
about the Rembrandt itself?

198
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:27,418
The details about her providence,
they're all in here.

199
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,637
This girl in the window's traveled
all over the world.

200
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:42,766
Paris, London, Berlin. She's lived
a much more exciting life than me.

201
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,185
Except now she's probably rolled up
in the back of somebody's van.

202
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:49,107
Well, let's hope she got it all
out of her system first.

203
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,359
- This is interesting.
- You got something?

204
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,532
Maybe. Right after Rembrandt painted
the young girl in 1645, he sold it.

205
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,201
At that point, it sort of bounced around
for a few 100 years,

206
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,704
17th century Paris,
kind of skimmed this part,

207
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:07,291
until it was purchased by a Prussian
nobleman who kept it until he died.

208
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,211
Then his family kept it till 1932

209
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,631
until Franz von Papen
dissolved the Free State of Prussia.

210
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,216
I thought you said this was interesting.

211
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,135
Look, I'm trying to care
about this case, okay?

212
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:22,055
Which at the moment is just saving an
insurance company from having to pay money

213
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,683
to a couple of people
who seem to be doing just fine.

214
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,893
Where did she go next?

215
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:31,064
To a Polish businessman in Kraków,
and he hung it in his family home.

216
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,359
Then it just kind of bounced around
from collection to collection

217
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,654
until good old Greg
and Linda paid a fortune for it.

218
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,032
Why is any of this important?

219
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,824
I don't know yet.

220
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,785
Lab results came back on those slags
we found on the museum floor,

221
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,080
tested positive for aluminum oxide,
so I did some research.

222
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,458
<i>When aluminum combines with ferric oxide,</i>

223
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,169
<i>it creates a thermite reaction
hot enough to melt glass.</i>

224
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,838
<i>That would explain why we didn't
find any glass shards under the sky light.</i>

225
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,132
It also came up in a report
on another museum heist.

226
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,552
Two years ago, a Matisse was stolen
from the Kunsthal Museum in Rotterdam.

227
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,430
<i>And aluminum oxide was found
under the museum sky light.</i>

228
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,724
Which might mean
this isn't our thief's first rodeo.

229
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,351
You and Daphne look for others.

230
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,979
So far we found 19 heists around the world
with the same MO.

231
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,733
Always a masterpiece stolen from
a gallery. Always worth 10 to 30 million.

232
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,985
And traces of aluminum oxide
at every scene

233
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,613
under a window
or a skylight just like ours.

234
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,989
We have any idea who it might be?

235
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,409
Well, the internet seems to think so.
Some call him Jean-Baptiste.

236
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,871
- He's French?
- No, but the first painting he stole was.

237
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,165
"<i>The White Duck</i> by Jean-Baptiste Oudrey."

238
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,751
Stolen in Paris, 12 years ago.

239
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,211
Tell me somebody's got eyes on him.

240
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,380
Only once.

241
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,632
He tried to steal a Picasso
in Madrid five years ago,

242
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,468
but a guard shot him in the left shoulder,
and he fled empty handed.

243
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,264
- Okay, so why can't anybody find this guy?
- Because he might not exist.

244
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,682
- He could be a myth.
- What do you mean?

245
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,058
I mean, it's impressive work,

246
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,978
but the name Jean-Baptiste comes up
whenever there's a heist unsolved,

247
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,439
the thief got in and out without a trace,
escaped with another masterpiece.

248
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,732
Must be Jean-Baptiste.

249
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:59,278
But is he real? Maybe.
It could be ten different guys.

250
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,947
Check this out. I searched public records.

251
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,658
Someone sued claiming
to be the Rembrandt's rightful owner.

252
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:05,742
We have a name?

253
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,036
Yeah, an Ari Weisman,
but it looks like the records are sealed.

254
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,622
Ari would be the first guy to take matters
into his own hands

255
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,749
- when the court ruled against him.
- We got an address?

256
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,544
Yeah, looks like he's local.

257
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:18,423
Captain, I could use a hand from
Detectives Ozdil and Forrester for a bit.

258
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,466
Is this about that cold case?

259
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:23,761
It is.

260
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,056
You heard the lieutenant?

261
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,142
Can I help with anything?

262
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,186
No, I'm good. I'll keep you posted.

263
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,732
Why don't you guys go find out
if this Ari Weisman responds

264
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,276
to the name Jean-Baptiste?

265
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,243
We just wanted the painting back.

266
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,328
How badly?

267
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,123
Enough to sue, not steal.

268
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,709
Sorry, you think
that painting belonged to you?

269
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,712
Not me, my grandma.

270
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:02,300
My father bought that painting in 1932.

271
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:07,512
I remember the day he hang it up
on the wall.

272
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:13,019
<i>Whenever we all got together,
there was the girl smiling down to us.</i>

273
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,438
Always felt she felt
like part of the family.

274
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,815
Your father had wonderful taste.

275
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,109
It's a very special piece.

276
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,569
One of my favorites.

277
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,155
We lived in Kraków.

278
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:30,995
My father, my mother, and my two brothers,
Jacob and Samuel.

279
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,164
I was the youngest.

280
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,463
The only one in our family that survived.

281
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,717
When the Nazis came...

282
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,304
they took everything.

283
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,145
I'm so sorry.

284
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,148
We're still here.

285
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,653
I'm guessing you searched
the auction catalogs for years.

286
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,448
I thought she'd never find it, and
then one day there it was, up for sale.

287
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:13,121
The owners.
They wanted to sell it to us.

288
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,456
For $20 million.

289
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,418
We don't have $20 million.

290
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,421
The court said
we couldn't prove it was stolen.

291
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,924
Is that all?

292
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,515
Actually, Ari, we have to ask,
where were you last night?

293
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,269
I was here with my grandma.

294
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,397
I saw your name
on the museum visitor logs.

295
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,399
You were there a couple of days ago.

296
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,152
I wanted to take a photo to show to her.

297
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,362
Have you traveled
outside the country the last few years?

298
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,531
No.

299
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,491
No, but she keeps asking me
to take her to Poland.

300
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,327
She wants to visit
the house where she grew up.

301
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,872
She's not doing much traveling now.

302
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,083
That painting was the closest
she'll come to going home.

303
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,627
Please.

304
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,630
Thank you.

305
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,558
Thanks for the assist, you guys.

306
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,187
Once every item is tagged, photographed,
and packaged for forensics--

307
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,856
I'll get TID to get started
on data extraction on his phone.

308
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,358
Hopefully, we uncover
text messages, call logs.

309
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,985
You want fiber analysis on the backpack?

310
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,612
All of it. I want the works.

311
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,156
This much activity,
people gonna start asking questions.

312
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,450
What are we saying
if the captain asks what we're doing?

313
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,827
Tell him to talk to me.

314
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,413
And let's run this stack of photos
through facial recognition.

315
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,498
Okay.

316
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,796
Okay, let's go over it one last time.

317
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,424
- Mom, I got it. Trust me.
- I do trust you.

318
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,469
That's why I'm paying you a premium
instead of hiring a babysitter.

319
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,930
You've literally rejected
every babysitter in California.

320
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,182
And I wouldn't say
you're paying me a premium.

321
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:00,727
It is a perfectly reasonable wage
based on current market conditions.

322
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,147
Listen, Chloe's routine has changed
since she's down a nap.

323
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,440
So can you just indulge me?

324
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,275
Nap time from one to three.

325
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,777
Classical music on low.

326
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,363
For lunch, she gets half a grilled cheese
and mushed up zucchini.

327
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,907
After that, she can play with her blocks,
and if she gets frustrated,

328
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,992
then distract her
with the singing giraffe.

329
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,661
- I wanna be very clear about something.
- Hmm.

330
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,914
She's gonna get frustrated
and she will throw those blocks.

331
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,792
- I'll be prepared.
- Okay, perfect.

332
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,876
Oh, wait, Mom. Hold on a sec.

333
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,961
Can this wait? I got to go.

334
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,170
I know,

335
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,131
but I just wanted to know what the cops
are doing with Dad's stuff from his bag.

336
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,009
Did they find anything yet?

337
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,761
These things take time.

338
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,055
I know, but can't you push them
to make it go faster?

339
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,474
Can't you be patient, please?

340
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,518
Listen, there's a reason
I gave his stuff to them, okay?

341
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,019
They're gonna find something
and when they do,

342
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,104
I'll let you know, I promise.

343
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,856
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.

344
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,318
Also, I'm pretty sure that singing giraffe
is broken, so best of luck to you. Bye.

345
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,446
- Is it really? No, Mom.
- Love you.

346
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,117
And what is your job at the museum?

347
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,577
I'm a gallery attendant.

348
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,496
I've been the assistant curator
at The Harbach for almost twenty years.

349
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,956
I just collect tickets and the paycheck.

350
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,333
I don't know anything
about that painting getting stolen.

351
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,669
Did you notice anything
out of the ordinary the past few weeks?

352
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,296
Maybe a visitor lingering around.

353
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,381
Mmm. One sneezed on a Vermeer last week,

354
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:16,387
so I showed him Caravaggio's
<i>Judith Beheading Holofernes</i> as a warning.

355
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,098
How'd you get that bruise on your face?

356
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,891
Took a nap on the floor.

357
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,643
Hmm.

358
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,812
Are you sure you haven't seen
anything out of the ordinary?

359
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,773
I noticed a guy hanging
around the Rembrandt a few days ago.

360
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,192
He looked familiar,
like I'd see him a few times,

361
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,236
but I mean, we see a lot of faces.

362
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,238
Do you remember anything
specific about him?

363
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,617
I remember thinking,
he looked like he went for a run.

364
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,457
Yeah, that's him.

365
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,004
Oh, come on.

366
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,464
We have to consider Ari a suspect.

367
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,884
He has means, motive, and his alibi wants
the Rembrandt just as much as he does.

368
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,012
Yeah, because the painting
belongs to her. Am I right?

369
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,763
I don't disagree, but--

370
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,139
No, but nothing.

371
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,976
Listen, the Weismans are
the victims here, not the suspects.

372
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,229
Are you picturing Miriam Weisman
rappelling through a skylight?

373
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,066
Well, Ari's a gymnast.
I can totally picture him doing it.

374
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:14,444
Look, all the museum employees
that we've talked to so far have alibis.

375
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,987
Morgan, what are you doing?

376
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,989
I am fixing our crime board

377
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,575
and correcting the timeline to include

378
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,369
the first time
that the painting was stolen.

379
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,453
In 1939.

380
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,790
Well, why confine ourselves
to solving crimes in the 21st century?

381
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,500
If we find <i>The Young Girl</i>,

382
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,293
we should be returning it
to Miriam Weisman,

383
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,462
not the Fosters.

384
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,547
I got to take this.

385
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,132
Morgan, it's not that simple.

386
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,718
I don't know what to tell you.
There's gotta be something we can do.

387
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,471
Well, even if we had the jurisdiction
to resolve a crime from 80 years ago,

388
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,391
it's just not how the system works.

389
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,393
I really wish there was more we could do.

390
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,664
Who was that?

391
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,248
Excuse me?

392
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,375
Who was that?

393
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,460
You said that thieves love
to talk to people

394
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,129
and sometimes those people call you.

395
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,423
Was that people calling?

396
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,258
A man called.

397
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,846
Claims he knows where the painting is.
He wants to meet with me to discuss.

398
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,557
Where?

399
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,392
You don't wanna tell me

400
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,978
'cause you're worried if the police
get involved, they're gonna ruin it?

401
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:33,899
If we spook whoever this guy is,
we may never recover the painting.

402
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,779
- Fine, then I'm coming with you.
- I can't show up with the cops.

403
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,282
I don't see any cops, do you?

404
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,624
Where is this guy?

405
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,876
He's late.

406
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,503
And why exactly is he calling you?

407
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,548
Well, not to sound insufferable, but
I'm the only person that does what I do.

408
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,926
Sorry, you were trying
to not sound insufferable?

409
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,555
Well, from what I gather, you're the only
person that does what you do too.

410
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,266
It's a little different, but sure.

411
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,353
Well, I think we have some time to spare.

412
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,022
Let's see how this guy got in.

413
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,776
- Knock yourself out.
- Come on, you're coming with me.

414
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,570
I need your insufferable talents
on that roof.

415
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,414
If I could just... Hello.

416
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,211
Lieutenant, you got a second?

417
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,296
Good news only.

418
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,214
Well, TID is backed up.

419
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,633
Hobson says cracking
that BlackBerry could take weeks,

420
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,092
too many phones, not enough texts.

421
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,345
Remind her of the parking ticket
I got her mother out of

422
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,930
in front of the Van Nuys courthouse.

423
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,015
She owes me.

424
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,391
You know the difference
between good news and bad?

425
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,727
I ran those photos in the backpack
through facial recognition.

426
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,854
No criminal record
on the ones we could match

427
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,773
parking tickets, traffic stops,
nothing major.

428
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,818
- And the ones we couldn't match?
- Only one.

429
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,950
All right, I'll take it from here.

430
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,090
Did you know there's
a German diaper derby competition?

431
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,216
It's held annually in Bavaria.

432
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,927
Contestants are judged
on speed, efficiency,

433
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,639
and the artistic flourish
of the diaper application.

434
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,850
- I do well.
- Is Chloe napping or not?

435
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,853
Yes, which brings me to my next point.

436
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:38,606
Since I'm helping you babysit
and not being babysat...

437
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,359
I'll give you 10% of my pay.

438
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,157
Fine, 20%.

439
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,243
Deal.

440
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,161
And I won't tell Mom
you're going through her clothes.

441
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,455
How generous of you.

442
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,726
What if we promise not to touch anything?

443
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,103
That works for me.

444
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,859
Have you ever stolen anything?

445
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,445
Nothing with a provenance, you?

446
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,656
Yes, stole a classmate's trainers
once in primary school.

447
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:31,117
Scotland Yard know about this?

448
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,328
He deserved it.

449
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,165
Used to kick this kid, Gideon,
in the shins with those shoes at recess.

450
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,625
Well, did you wear them to school?

451
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:41,794
No, I donated them to a thrift store
right by the bus stop.

452
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,881
That way he could see them
every time he looked through the window.

453
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,050
You monster.

454
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,678
- This glass is reflective.
- What do you mean?

455
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,097
These skylights all have
a one-way window film on them.

456
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,807
The thief wouldn't be able to see in.

457
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:58,562
It's a risky little game, breaking glass,
not knowing who's down there.

458
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,397
Excuse me.

459
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,192
We were just leaving.

460
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,320
The guard saw you come up here.
Are you Mr. Eastman?

461
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,820
Yeah, why?

462
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,865
One of my docents found this at the front.

463
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,368
They didn't see who left it.

464
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,095
So you go back to the crime scene
on your own without a police escort?

465
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,179
Well, yeah--

466
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,889
Detective Karadec,
did you know about this?

467
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,015
Know about what, sir?

468
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:39,102
The museum director just called me and
told me that your partner took Mr. Eastman

469
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,104
on a tour of the crime scene.

470
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,981
- That's...
- Ducked right under the tape,

471
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,108
and cut the seal.

472
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,151
Are you trying to sabotage
this investigation?

473
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,529
You made it quite clear
how you feel about this case.

474
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,573
No, I'm not trying to sabotage anything,
okay? I was trying to help.

475
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,618
He was going anyway. Would you prefer
I just let him go by himself?

476
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,829
Neither of you should've been there
in the first place.

477
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,706
Okay, I understand that. And I'm sorry.

478
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,666
But if we didn't,
we wouldn't have gotten this.

479
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,502
Whoever left this wants
to meet at 1:00 p.m.

480
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,215
That gives us less than 2 hours.

481
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,633
Are Forrester and Ozdil still
with the lieutenant?

482
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,218
You thinking a surveillance up?

483
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,178
Yes, and we need to see
the museum's security cameras.

484
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,347
Maybe we can get eyes
on whoever dropped this off.

485
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,349
Don't you think that Rhys should take
the lead on this though?

486
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,144
- And why would we do that?
- Because I'm who they want to speak to.

487
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:24,605
Great idea. I'll send Morgan with you
and you can tamper with more evidence.

488
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,690
Hey, I'm sorry, okay?

489
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,443
I'm sorry I went to a building
without your permission first.

490
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,904
- I see now that that was a bad idea.
- Bad idea?

491
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,075
How about reckless and insubordinate?

492
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,493
I just said I'm sorry.

493
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,538
I know that you don't like rules,
but when you're in my precinct,

494
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,958
I expect you to follow my command.

495
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,295
You practice that in a mirror?

496
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,050
- Morgan, calm--
- Do not tell me to calm down.

497
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,927
We need to grab someone from the SIS.

498
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,096
The sooner that we get
to the ransom's location,

499
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,765
the sooner that we can start surveillance.

500
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,517
- Okay, great. Rhys and I will follow you.
- No.

501
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,853
Detective Karadec and I can handle it
from here.

502
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,730
Our consultants have done enough.

503
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,233
Are you kicking me off the case?

504
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,818
I walked up on a roof!

505
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,988
Oh, great. The Fosters
are on their way up. They want an update.

506
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,574
Talk to them. I'll be waiting downstairs.
Just make it quick.

507
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,993
What is going on?

508
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,953
Morgan, what were you thinking?

509
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,039
I get it!

510
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,878
This is why I work alone.

511
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,425
Do you drink alone?

512
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,804
- I prefer to have company.
- Great.

513
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,348
Good luck.

514
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,439
You believe that guy?

515
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,567
Kicking me off the case
so he can go follow a lead that we found.

516
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,737
He knows how I work. I do my thing
and then cases get solved, right?

517
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,072
What's wrong with that?

518
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,866
Nothing's wrong with that, Rhys.
That's the answer to that question.

519
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,201
You have every right to be upset.

520
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,829
Yeah, I know I do
because he called me out like I'm a child.

521
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,040
I have kids,
I don't even talk to them like that.

522
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:08,669
What?

523
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,088
Boys, girls, mix?

524
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,506
Mix. Don't change the subject.
I gotta get this out.

525
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,882
And why are we still driving?

526
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,344
Shouldn't we be
eating and drinking by now?

527
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,304
Are you suggesting I go faster?

528
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,348
Look at the car you're driving.
We just got passed by a Subaru.

529
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,934
You should be ashamed of yourself.

530
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,022
Where did you get this?

531
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,566
Our consultants came across it.

532
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,609
Good news is your painting
doesn't appear to be damaged.

533
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,862
What happens now?

534
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,946
We're supposed to pay the ransom?

535
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,364
That's not what I said, sir.

536
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,950
The LAPD never pays ransom.
We don't suggest that you do either.

537
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,369
I don't believe this.
So what do you suggest that we do?

538
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,288
Are we just gonna sit here and do nothing?

539
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,456
Detective, we have been waiting
by the phone,

540
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,917
and we have heard nothing, and now this?

541
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,212
Who sent you this?
Do you have any leads? Anything?

542
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,132
We're assembling a team to follow
that lead and recover your painting.

543
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:59,719
And how long does it take
to assemble this team of yours?

544
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,721
They're assembling
in the war room right now,

545
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,307
and I should be with them instead of here.

546
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:07,518
Detective, we just want her back.

547
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,478
I understand, sir.
Let us handle the response.

548
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,565
We'll get back to you
when we find out more.

549
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,735
Thank you
for keeping us informed, Detective.

550
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:16,987
Of course.

551
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,657
- Just a little bit more.
- Yes, sir.

552
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,868
Thanks, bro.

553
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:29,165
<i>- This is Arthur.</i>
- Hi, this is Ava Sinquerra.

554
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,416
Boss, you want us to--

555
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,085
<i>Hello?</i>

556
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,379
Um...

557
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,758
I just wanted to call you because there's
something I didn't get an answer to

558
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,093
at the diner 'cause my mom flipped out.

559
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,346
Well, how does your mom feel
about you calling me?

560
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,598
<i>Oh, this call never happened.</i>

561
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,602
Actually, I should probably tell her
so she won't ground me again.

562
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,937
<i>Yeah, well, it sounds like a wise move.</i>

563
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:53,773
Look, Ava, I'm in the middle of working
right now, so--

564
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,151
You said that I reminded you of my dad?

565
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,156
What was he like?

566
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,745
Hello?

567
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,792
Look, I won't bother you again.
I promise. I just...

568
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:17,296
I'm sorry. Maybe this wasn't such
a good idea. I'll just leave you alone.

569
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,092
No, no, just hold on a second.

570
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,344
If you wanna have a serious talk
about your dad,

571
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,180
then we have to do it the right way.

572
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,892
I don't know, maybe me, you,
and your mom, we could...

573
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:33,146
<i>I don't know. Find ourselves back
at that diner at some point.</i>

574
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,147
<i>How does that sound to you?</i>

575
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,775
Sure, yeah.

576
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,237
Listen, Ava, until that happens,
you and I, we can't...

577
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,996
Look, Roman didn't always do things
the easy way,

578
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,373
<i>but he always did things the right way.</i>

579
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:55,001
I mean, he had a lot to do with me
getting my life together

580
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:58,422
and believe me,
he saved my ass more than once.

581
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,970
He's a stand-up guy through and through.

582
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,057
Well, look, Ava,
I gotta get back to work here.

583
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,852
- Hey, Arthur.
- Yeah.

584
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:15,147
Thank you.

585
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,691
Of course, sweetheart.

586
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,836
Everything all right, Detective?
Something on your mind?

587
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:44,300
You know, I read somewhere carrying
around unexpressed frustrations is like

588
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,843
carrying a heavy backpack.

589
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,847
Every unspoken thought adds
another stone to the load,

590
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,933
making your journey much more difficult.

591
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,394
- She's confused, sir.
- Hmm.

592
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,480
Yeah, so am I.

593
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,231
You're confused?

594
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,611
Sir, is there something you wanna tell me?

595
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,450
I can't protect you
if I don't know where you are.

596
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,162
I have to be in a position to help
if things go south.

597
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,123
I need to know everything,

598
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,210
and that's not because I don't trust her,

599
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,712
but because I do.

600
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,509
Still confused?

601
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,134
No.

602
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:32,766
Good. Because the same applies
to you and everyone else. You understand?

603
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,519
Yes, sir.

604
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,981
Next time you lose your cool with her.
I'd suggest you find a different approach.

605
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,733
Oh, yeah. Why is that?

606
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,486
Because if you don't,
it's gonna put me and you in a position

607
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,239
where things will definitely go south.

608
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,966
All clear.

609
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,099
Just getting a little impatient.

610
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,934
Don't worry.
The ransomer will turn up soon.

611
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,103
With you, Detective.

612
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,188
Impatient with me. Why?

613
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,692
We're sitting here nice and quiet.
Nothing but time for you to read me in.

614
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,069
Read you in on what?

615
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,198
Roman Sinquerra.

616
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,203
Come on, Adam.

617
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,831
You don't think I see things?

618
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,085
What do you wanna know?

619
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:49,718
Oh. We don't have time for this.
It'll blow our cover.

620
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,053
Or spook our ransomer.

621
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,348
We're here for the painting,
not some car thief.

622
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,392
Leave it alone.

623
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,394
He's committing a crime. I...

624
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,021
I'll handle this.

625
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,480
Detective.

626
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,609
Hey! Hey, man, that's my car.

627
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,237
What are you doing?
Bro, get out of my car now.

628
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,282
Whoa! LAPD, put the gun down.

629
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:17,621
Now. At your feet. Let's go.
Put that gun down now.

630
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,667
Drop it. On the ground.

631
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,130
Good. Keep your hands
where I can see 'em, son.

632
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,760
Hey, that's our guy. Let's go!

633
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,481
Hey! Hey!

634
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,942
Move!

635
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,614
- Wait, so now you're stealing the car.
- That's right. It's your lucky day.

636
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,548
- Detective.
- <i>You took my car, sir.</i>

637
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,468
Yeah, I couldn't wait.
He was getting away.

638
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,352
Well, I'm right behind you.

639
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,312
What? You stole that car?

640
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:29,733
<i>No, sir. I commandeered a private vehicle
in an emergency because you left me.</i>

641
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,904
I had no choice.
I told you not to mess with that guy.

642
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,366
He was committing a crime!

643
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,918
Get out of that car, Detective.
You hear me?

644
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,800
Yes, I hear you, sir.

645
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,806
Pull over right now!

646
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,642
<i>Pull to the side of the road.</i>

647
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,024
Need some help?

648
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,525
I got it handled.

649
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,202
- That was close.
- I'm well aware!

650
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,831
I'm gonna make my move!

651
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,667
What move? No move!

652
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,402
Let's pull a two-vehicle box-in.

653
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,655
Just pull over and get
a chopper in the air.

654
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,074
We need eyes in the sky.

655
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,744
Just listen to me, Detective!

656
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,885
Had we both been in one car,
I think that we...

657
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,349
Never mind.

658
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,979
<i>I'm not even convinced
he should have the job.</i>

659
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,524
I mean, Lieutenant Solo was
absolutely qualified.

660
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,275
Well, how did he get the promotion?

661
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,403
Politics, nepotism, I guess.

662
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:40,072
You know what it might be? He's tall.

663
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,658
Data shows taller people
get promoted faster. Did you know that?

664
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,369
But if you can't buy pants off the rack,
what's the point of living?

665
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:49,289
Okay. When's the last time
you bought pants off a rack?

666
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,584
Pretty sure there's a tailor in London
who's got your inseam memorized.

667
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,003
Well, you know,
I do like clothes that fit.

668
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,256
Mm-hmm, I can tell.

669
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:02,220
You think you know me? But you can't get
past the accent, can you?

670
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,640
I mean, you do sound like you were born
clutching a croquet mallet.

671
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,935
Well, let me share something with you.

672
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,480
My father, he was a bin man.

673
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,817
Always out collecting
other people's rubbish.

674
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,944
All the kids at school,
they used to make fun of me.

675
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,989
They said that they could smell it on me,

676
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,867
but when I walked into a museum,

677
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,578
I was staring up at the same beauty
as kings and queens,

678
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,122
like, this kid from Stevenage.

679
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,583
It didn't matter who I was.

680
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:36,254
I mean, <i>The Mona Lisa</i> smiled at me
like she smiled at everyone.

681
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,340
Mmm.

682
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,385
I'm gonna be honest, I'm still really
pissed, so I wasn't fully listening,

683
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,764
but I did hear bin man and Mona Lisa.

684
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,767
Not exactly sure how they're connected,
but I bet it was poignant.

685
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,393
- It was.
- Mm-hmm.

686
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,438
- I mean, I'm glad you didn't hear it.
- Mmm?

687
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,482
You don't strike me
as a girl that's attracted to someone

688
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,026
that's so sentimental anyway.

689
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,988
Hmm. What am I attracted to?

690
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:05,992
I think you appreciate a challenge.

691
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:14,958
I think you need something exciting enough
to get you out of that head of yours.

692
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,044
Really?

693
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,087
Like what?

694
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,758
I have a few ideas.

00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,644

706
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,182
<i>In my experience,
it's always about money.</i>

707
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,600
Have you ever stolen anything?

708
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,060
<i>Jean-Baptiste might not exist.</i>

709
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,648
It could be a myth. It's a very
special piece, one of my favorites.

710
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,360
I should get that.

711
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,531
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

712
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,075
I'm down at the museum,
and you're gonna wanna see this.

713
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,621
Our case just got blown wide open.

725
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,758
I want that backpack.
