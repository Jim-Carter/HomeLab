1
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:19,603
-Previously on "Robin Hood."
-[panting]

2
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,272
Hear now,
the good Sheriff

3
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,733
has placed a reward
of 200 ducats

4
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:26,277
for the murderer
Robert of Locksley.

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,320
Then he won't be
at the Western Ridge no more.

6
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:31,574
BISHOP: It was your wish
to have Locksley arrested.

7
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,577
You are the father
of all this.

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,204
I'll join the hunt,
I'll kill the boy,

9
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:38,914
and I'll take your half.

10
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:41,208
You chose
to defile yourself

11
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:43,043
before marriage
with Lefors.

12
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,504
That child is
an affront to my name.

13
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:47,423
-VOICE: Who are you?
-I'm Rob, of Sherwood.

14
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,425
-And the three of you are?
-The Miller brothers.

15
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,343
I'm Ralph,
that's Drew, he's Henry.

16
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:53,804
Marian of Huntingdon,
I'm Celene De Fitzou,

17
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,306
Dame d'Honneur to Her Majesty.

18
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,558
You're on duty
from sunrise to sunset,

19
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,269
that means ready before dawn,
and you start with bed duties.

20
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,937
-You're a girl.
-Maybe tomorrow

21
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,189
-you can teach me.
-You ready?

22
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,070
[horse neighing]

23
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,156
Hey!

24
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:15,451
-Aah!
-Who are you?

25
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,661
-You're hiding from something.
-The Sheriff's after me.

26
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,456
Alive!
I want a public execution!

27
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,042
[horse neighing]

28
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,835
-Sheriff.
-Huntingdon.

29
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,378
If they're going west,
they're headed

30
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,172
for the River Trent,
believing Sherwood will

31
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,882
-offer them safety.
-We'd like to join the hunt

32
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,050
to ensure they don't.

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,597
So, which one of you is
Locksley, then?

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,308
-[grunting]
-Down, you, down!

35
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,601
Come on...

36
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,021
[screaming]

37
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,315
Pain? Just remember
that no man has

38
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,943
ever earned a name
worth having without it.

39
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,031
ROB: Run, John! Run!

40
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,324
[gasping]

41
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,116
My boy.

42
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,703
Locksley!

43
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,022
[gentle music]

44
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,951
MARIAN: It's strange,
the things I remember

45
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,621
from that night
in the forest with you.

46
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,123
The way you made me feel.

47
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,792
Like I was floating.

48
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,629
If God would grand me
eternity in that place,

49
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,797
it's all I'd ever need.

50
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,883
That moment with you,

51
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,509
I can never forget.

52
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:40,888
What was the name
of that tree?

53
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,474
Is it too much to hope

54
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,309
that a night like that
can happen again?

55
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,437
I think of you, Rob.

56
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,939
Every day.

57
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,817
It's been weeks now.

58
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,487
I have to imagine
you're doing much better.

59
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,114
Preparing for a life
as a forester, no doubt.

60
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,910
At the palace,
at least I have found

61
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,787
one small sanctuary.

62
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,956
A place
in the Queen's gardens.

63
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,504
When I gaze up,

64
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,631
I imagine I'm in Sherwood.

65
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,675
Right beside you.

66
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,426
I miss you, Rob.

67
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,680
I am always
and forever yours.

68
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,264
Marian.

69
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,904
GEROLD:
The forest is vast, my Lord.

70
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,322
Parts uncharted.

71
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,491
They could be anywhere
from the Western Ridge

72
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,867
to Southwell.

73
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,869
Or the northern reaches
of Oxford.

74
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,871
We're but 50 men.

75
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,540
We'd need more to find them.

76
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,041
Many more.

77
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,876
Mm.

78
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,211
Give the Bishop a drink.

79
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,173
Why not bring men
from the garrisons at Warwick?

80
00:04:58,257 --> 00:04:59,633
Or Leicester?

81
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,885
They'll want coin for that.

82
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,804
There's not enough
in the town's coffers.

83
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,974
Who will pay?

84
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:11,729
Still, we must deal with this.
The question is how.

85
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,314
There are plenty
of thieves and brigands

86
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:17,109
hiding in the forest,
what's a few more amongst them?

87
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,737
Besides, they'll perish
soon enough from lack of food.

88
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,822
The forest is
a godforsaken place.

89
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,699
Nothing survives there
for long.

90
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,703
Except the Saxons,
who seem built for its habitat.

91
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,206
Leave us.

92
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,337
One of Huntingdon's boys
was killed.

93
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,968
-I heard.
-I want you to...

94
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:45,554
preside over his funeral.

95
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,557
Priscilla will accompany you
to represent me.

96
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,479
I wish Huntingdon had
never come to me.

97
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:58,692
His greed is
the cause of this unrest.

98
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,489
Now the men say
the forest is haunted.

99
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,700
Haunted?

100
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:10,245
By some...

101
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:11,705
unholy spirit,

102
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:14,291
one that protects
the Saxon outlaws.

103
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,544
Pagan superstition was never
a match for Norman steel.

104
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,839
Or the war horse.
It trampled Saxon beliefs

105
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,342
when we conquered these shores.
It will do so again.

106
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,177
You forget one thing, Bishop.

107
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,681
The war horse is useless
in the forest.

108
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,519
[eerie music]

109
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,945
JOHN:
No dog deserved that.

110
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,998
[eerie whispers]

111
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,339
[echoing thud]

112
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,676
[rapping]

113
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,222
-Tell him to be quiet.
-He's hungry is all.

114
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,765
We all are.

115
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,475
We could get food
from the woodcutters.

116
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,060
-They'll help us.
-The Sheriff will have

117
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:16,728
thought of that.

118
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:17,980
You think there'll be
soldiers in the villages?

119
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,857
Be sure of it.

120
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,402
If we want to stay alive,
we stay in the forest.

121
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,195
The deer have moved
too close to Nottingham

122
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,739
for us to hunt.
We can't chance it.

123
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,075
And the rabbit alone
won't be enough.

124
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,161
Then what do we do?

125
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,745
There's plenty
to be had elsewhere.

126
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,165
We just need
the guts to take it.

127
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,625
-Where?
-ROB: The road to Hereford.

128
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,002
Yeah.

129
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,795
It's the biggest market
north of Oxford.

130
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,007
We want to eat,
that's where the food is.

131
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,759
DREW: Let's go then,
I'm hungry.

132
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:50,429
It'll be dark soon.
We'll leave in the morning.

133
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:53,974
Are you all right?

134
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,189
He was young,
only a bit older than me.

135
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:02,941
He would have killed Drew,

136
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,069
but you saved him.

137
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,243
[gentle music]

138
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,088
Father.

139
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,634
Is it true?

140
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,470
One of Huntingdon's sons
was killed by Locksley?

141
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:38,018
Gerold said it was impossible
to see who it was.

142
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,648
Doesn't matter.
They're all guilty.

143
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,734
The Bishop said
we should forget about them.

144
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,861
Leave them
in the woods to die.

145
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,989
Since when did Saxons killing
Normans go unpunished?

146
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,699
Let alone forgotten?

147
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,786
The Bishop is a fool, Father.

148
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,331
They must be captured
and held to account.

149
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:03,001
If Saxons can wantonly
disregard our laws,

150
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,087
then what does it even mean
to be Norman?

151
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,633
They will be caught.

152
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,178
And they will pay.

153
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,482
CELENE:
Nottingham!

154
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,318
You need a firm hand
with that one.

155
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,990
[sighs]

156
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,718
Marian, focus on your work.

157
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,678
This is the palace.

158
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,225
I've been ruminating
on our problem.

159
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,144
-Yes?
-We will put up

160
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,688
a new reward for Locksley
and those he runs with.

161
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,940
A reward large enough
to bring in

162
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,901
200 men
who will hunt him down.

163
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:13,030
-We?
-Yes, we.

164
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,407
Half will come
from Nottingham's coffers.

165
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,951
The other half,
from the Abbey.

166
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:21,246
[chuckling]
Oh, my Lord...

167
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,790
the Abbey doesn't have funds
for such an endeavor.

168
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,710
We barely have enough
to feed and clothe our flock.

169
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,713
Besides, the boy is nothing.

170
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,173
I know.

171
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,800
Yet he sets
a dangerous precedent.

172
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,719
Which we must deal with.

173
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,765
Rebellion can spread,

174
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,850
like a plague.

175
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,104
The crown expects us
to keep the peace, both of us.

176
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:49,483
If we can't, then no matter
my relation with Henry

177
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:53,195
or yours to Rome,
we become expendable.

178
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,448
Locksley is a burden
we both share.

179
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,493
Once they're caught,
the moneys will be repaid

180
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,995
-from taxes.
-My Lord.

181
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,167
There is another matter.

182
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,168
Priscilla.

183
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,091
-Priscilla.
-After Aronne's funeral,

184
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,427
I wish you to take her
to the convent.

185
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,888
Priscilla is bright,

186
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,265
more capable
than most men I know,

187
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,727
but... she is...

188
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,604
spirited.

189
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,440
Being third cousin to the King,
Henry her godfather,

190
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,109
she has a name to live up to.

191
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,987
The convent
is where she will best

192
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,864
be protected from herself,

193
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:40,617
before her eventual betrothal.

194
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,452
I understand.

195
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,371
[birds chirping]

196
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,667
He's on his way
to Hereford Market, no doubt.

197
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,710
And that way?

198
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,422
Leicester
and to Watling Street,

199
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,132
all the way
to London town.

200
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,926
-You've been to London?
-Many times.

201
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,011
I ain't never seen
nothing like it.

202
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,596
Folks there like ants.

203
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,349
I want a closer look.

204
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,725
Come on, Henry.

205
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:15,610
What's up with that one?

206
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,531
Her name is Ralph.

207
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,158
Wolf in sheep's clothing.

208
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,994
-Probably kept her safe.
-So she says.

209
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,374
The boy she killed...

210
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,794
he wasn't a bad person.

211
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,631
He was hunting us.

212
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,216
He would've killed
any of us gladly.

213
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,426
It's not on us.

214
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,887
This is the fault
of the Normans.

215
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,390
If we're bad men,
they made us so.

216
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,567
A supply wagon to the Abbey.

217
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,361
-They'll have food.
-Eh, we should leave them be.

218
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,363
They're men of God.

219
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,157
Not our God.

220
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,367
[wagon rattling]

221
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,871
[rattling]

222
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,335
[rattling nears]

223
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:19,174
[dramatic music]

224
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,217
Stop!

225
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:24,012
[neighing]

226
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,264
MAN: No, no,
leave us, please!

227
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,475
Get away,
or I'll bash you.

228
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,187
Stop!

229
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,943
I'm not afraid of you.

230
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,653
You think I'm just
going to let you steal?

231
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,321
I think, for your sake,
you should.

232
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,658
[distant grunts]

233
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,954
Follow your friend.
I don't want to hurt you.

234
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,874
[screaming]

235
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:58,672
Enough!

236
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,945
Come on, fellow.
Back to the Abbey.

237
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,780
I can't go back.

238
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,117
-Henry.
-Huh?

239
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,286
Give me a hand.

240
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,621
-Let's get him on the cart.
-No, no, no--

241
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,832
I can't go back.

242
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,625
They'll whip me.

243
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,254
You seemed
to handle yourself fine here.

244
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,341
It won't be a fight.
It'll be a cell.

245
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,761
The Abbott is not
a kind man.

246
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,813
[sighing]
He'll perish out here.

247
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,650
Robbed... or beaten.

248
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,235
Well, he can't come with us.
He's a Norman.

249
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,405
FRIAR:
Where else am I to go?

250
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,866
I am in this situation
because of you.

251
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,701
-Drew!
-Yeah?

252
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,161
Turn the cart around.

253
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,621
The horses will find
their way home.

254
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,416
[grunting]

255
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,877
Don't expect you'll stay long
with the likes of us.

256
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,547
Here.
Carry something.

257
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,849
[soft music]

258
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,369
[wind whooshing]

259
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,581
[neighing]

260
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,884
[clearing throat]

261
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,345
After the funeral,
you will travel on with me

262
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,181
-to Hereford Abbey.
-Hereford Abbey?

263
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,225
You are to reside there
under my wardship

264
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,685
in the convent.

265
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,021
What do you mean?

266
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,482
It's what your father
has decided.

267
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,942
For the benefit
of your welfare

268
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,528
and eventual betrothal.

269
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:30,031
You mean my virtue.

270
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:31,616
Let us pray
a suitor can be found

271
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,327
who's amiable to the task.

272
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,371
-I won't go.
-Yes, you will.

273
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,248
Otherwise you will live
the rest of your life

274
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,125
in servitude,
and your virtue will be

275
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,876
nothing but a withered rose.

276
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,880
Now come, Priscilla.

277
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,341
Let us pay our respects
to Earl Huntingdon

278
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,926
for the loss of his son.

279
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,440
Why didn't you run off
with your friend?

280
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,359
Oh, I baked that bread.
Collected the honey.

281
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,611
JOHN:
We were hungry.

282
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,195
That doesn't mean
you're free to steal.

283
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,463
ROB:
You're a Trappist.

284
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,590
You took a vow of silence.

285
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,592
Why would you choose
such a life?

286
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,969
My father wanted me
to be a priest.

287
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,346
He placed me
in the church as a boy.

288
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,391
But the Bishop sent me
to the Abbey to work.

289
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,643
Mm, like a slave, no doubt.

290
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,815
And you still dedicate
your life to Christ?

291
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,609
You should despise Him.

292
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,695
On the contrary,
Christ kept my faith.

293
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,114
He protected me all these years.

294
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:57,076
You should've said
I should despise the Bishop.

295
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,204
-Do you?
-He's a tyrant.

296
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,080
His faith only extends
to the gold

297
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,999
that lines his pockets
and all it buys him.

298
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,210
ROB: And why does your God
allow such behavior?

299
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,336
He doesn't allow it.

300
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,672
We do.

301
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,300
And you, what are you
hiding from out here?

302
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,718
I killed a man.

303
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,473
You'll surely pay for it.

304
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,683
Murder is a sin
in the eyes of the Lord.

305
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,811
My lord is Godda.

306
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,270
She is my protector.

307
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,523
Saxon gods will lead
to nothing but damnation

308
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,942
-and more violence.
-And Christ,

309
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,237
-I should put my faith in Him?
-If you wish to be saved, yes.

310
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,447
In a life devoted
to the Church,

311
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,366
you may find redemption.

312
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,169
What's your name?

313
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,462
Tuck.

314
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,132
Friar Tuck.

315
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,219
[Bishop speaking Latin]

316
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,143
[continuing in Latin]

317
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,062
[sobbing]

318
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,241
[continuing in Latin]

319
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,617
Amen.

320
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,472
The man you killed.

321
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,058
Who was he?

322
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,602
He was a Norman soldier.

323
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,813
A captain
of Nottingham's garrison.

324
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,232
He attacked you.

325
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,693
Like the men
who attacked us.

326
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,570
No, no.

327
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,450
I could've walked away.

328
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,076
I could've run.

329
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,456
But I didn't.

330
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,500
Do you wish you had?

331
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,505
I don't know, Ralph.

332
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,176
What would have it mattered?

333
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:21,679
The Normans are everywhere.

334
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,016
Where is there left to go?

335
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,400
Does the King ever leave France
to come to England?

336
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,319
Since I've been here,
only once.

337
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,072
And are the rumors true?

338
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,823
Did Eleanor lead
a revolt against Henry?

339
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,244
I don't know
the full truth.

340
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,622
But the King won't allow Eleanor
to leave England.

341
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,374
And her sons?

342
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,918
They say Richard will be
the next king.

343
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,336
And a great one,
I believe.

344
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,088
Richard is a true warrior.

345
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,298
What about the youngest?
Prince John?

346
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,509
Just once
Prince John was here.

347
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,344
He was quite pleasant
to look at.

348
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,137
A nobleman.

349
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,681
There was something
about him...

350
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,057
What?

351
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,059
Don't know, hard to say.

352
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:09,811
But if you stay around,

353
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,646
you'll be sure
to meet him one day.

354
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,566
[gentle music]

355
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,334
If I whisper your name,

356
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:34,836
will you hear me?

357
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,090
Rob.

358
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,431
Marian. Come on.

359
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,850
Don't dilly.

360
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,026
How's the new one doing?

361
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:00,319
Honestly, I don't know
why she's here.

362
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,405
I don't think
she does either.

363
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,866
Not everyone adapts
to palace life quite so easily.

364
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,037
Is everything ready?

365
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,372
Yes, Your Highness.

366
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,833
The Earl Marshal's ship landed
at Dover last night.

367
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,334
When do we expect him?

368
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,003
He should arrive today...

369
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,796
unless he's robbed en route.

370
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,633
Earl of Pembroke robbed?

371
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:24,927
What would England
be coming to?

372
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:29,390
An island of peasants,
poachers, and...

373
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,017
too many forests.

374
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,977
Indeed, France it is not.

375
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,687
But we shall endure.

376
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:38,066
Celene, bring her to me.

377
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,443
Your Highness?

378
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:41,527
Marian.

379
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,992
Yes, Your Highness.

380
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,834
Hold up, Mary.
Look here.

381
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,753
A bit of rough and tumble.

382
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:02,381
Cart on its way to market,
pilfered, most like.

383
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,133
It went...

384
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,678
but they went that way.

385
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,472
Then best we go that way.

386
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,892
Let's have a look.

387
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,685
Might be some food
in it for us.

388
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,735
[fire crackling softly]

389
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,751
What do you want?

390
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,670
To pay my respects.

391
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,215
Well, pay your respects
at Aronne's grave.

392
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:45,800
He's the one who's dead.

393
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,262
I am sorry for your loss.

394
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:55,309
It is a tragedy
for one to die so young.

395
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:57,979
Especially at the hands
of Saxon cowards.

396
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,817
This is all Locksley's doing.

397
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,154
I had him.

398
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,365
But he slipped away
and took my boy's life.

399
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:12,743
It's my fault.

400
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,080
Why do you say that?

401
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,374
I should have made sure
young Locksley was killed

402
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,127
along with his father.
Never leave

403
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,379
the son of an enemy alive.
One will always pay for that.

404
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,007
But I'll find him.
And I'll kill him.

405
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,012
But not today.

406
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,055
Today...

407
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,849
I will grieve.

408
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,851
A man...

409
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,644
shouldn't have
to grieve alone.

410
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,233
I could stay
with you tonight.

411
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,068
If you wish.

412
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,533
But in the eyes
of the Church, it...

413
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,579
it may be considered improper.

414
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,421
I'll handle the Bishop.

415
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:09,842
Another Norman soul lost.

416
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,720
And those Saxon murderers
run free.

417
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:13,763
[doors opening]

418
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,226
Where is she?
We should be on our way.

419
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:19,894
Priscilla has
offered to stay

420
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,104
to pack away
Aronne's belongings.

421
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,690
The Sheriff wants her taken
to the convent at Hereford.

422
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,776
Priscilla to the convent?

423
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,861
Bernard will see
she gets there tomorrow.

424
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,449
As you wish.

425
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,328
To Leicester.

426
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,843
Stop wasting time.

427
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,428
-I wanna get--
-Hold there.

428
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,434
I told you
we shouldn't've followed.

429
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:02,853
-We mean no harm.
-Who are you?

430
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:05,356
The name's Spragart.
That's Mary.

431
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,899
Thieves by profession.

432
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,903
Let him go.

433
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,578
Thought you were a poacher.

434
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,205
Well, I've got
many talents, ain't I?

435
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,875
You're Locksley,
I know you.

436
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,210
And I you.

437
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:27,795
I heard you killed a man.

438
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:32,466
We've all killed
plenty of folks.

439
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,552
Two more won't make
a difference.

440
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,595
Easy, boy.

441
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,431
We're all Saxons here.

442
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:41,225
We're hungry.

443
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,020
We haven't eaten in days.

444
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,938
You got any food?

445
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:48,107
We'll share our food,
but not our time.

446
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,704
Any trouble...

447
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,914
and this'll be
the last day you breathe.

448
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:09,920
[rustling]

449
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:15,009
That's Henry.
And Friar Tuck.

450
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:18,763
Right pretty bunch.
Fearsome, too.

451
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:21,724
No wonder the Sheriff put
a bounty on your head.

452
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,393
You in particular, Locksley,
made you worth a prince.

453
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:27,104
-Prince of Sherwood.
-You be thinking about it,

454
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:28,939
and this'll be
your reward.

455
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,067
We're hungry is all.

456
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,235
Put that down, you big lump.

457
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,739
I think
we found some kin, Mary.

458
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:40,242
-[grunting]
-Young Rob, in the hood.

459
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,328
We've got some things
in common, you and I.

460
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,330
I've nothing
in common with you.

461
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,082
Take food
and be on your way.

462
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,708
Mary and me can
help you steal more.

463
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,629
Hey.

464
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,297
I curse the Norman.

465
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,466
Spit on them
elitist whores.

466
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,968
They took everything from me.

467
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:00,096
Like they took your pa
and hung him straight.

468
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,350
We're the same,
you and me.

469
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,936
Saxon as the dirt
we was born on.

470
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,729
Now, what do you say?

471
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,689
We take their food.

472
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:13,442
-And hurt them all we can.
-[laughing]

473
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,404
If you want to hurt the Normans,
you don't steal their food.

474
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:23,327
You steal their money.

475
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:40,761
Come closer.

476
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:46,851
You're failing in your duties.

477
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,477
You apply yourself poorly,

478
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,813
and you don't know
a hard day's work.

479
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,815
How will you ever become
a lady in waiting?

480
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,693
Well? Am I wrong?

481
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,237
-No, Your Highness.
-I asked you before--

482
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,072
do you know
why you're here?

483
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,870
I was sent here
at my father's bequest.

484
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,204
I believe
the Sheriff arranged it.

485
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:09,665
At my burden, it would seem.

486
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,503
I will do better, then,
Your Highness. I promise.

487
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,172
[scoffs]

488
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,340
If you'd only heard
all the promises I'd been made.

489
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,093
Once I was promised Spain.

490
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:26,849
Look at me.

491
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,142
What do you see?

492
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,271
Your Highness?

493
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,148
What do you see?
It's a simple question.

494
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:37,651
A queen.

495
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,656
The Queen of England.

496
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,784
Queen of France,
Duchess of Aquitaine.

497
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,579
Heiress to
the House of Portiers.

498
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:52,249
And a wife of King Henry II.

499
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:55,628
All of that,
and yet I cannot leave England.

500
00:29:57,046 --> 00:30:00,174
I am detained, a captive.

501
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,052
Some even say
no better than a prisoner.

502
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,887
Sound familiar?

503
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:05,971
And yet...

504
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:13,020
from this palace,
I am informed.

505
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,105
I correspond.

506
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,107
I make allegiances.

507
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:19,735
I make decisions.

508
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,320
And I rule.

509
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,991
As women...

510
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,660
we are often put
in circumstances

511
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:30,037
not of our choosing.

512
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,540
But that doesn't mean
we don't have power

513
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,124
over the men
who put us there.

514
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:37,044
We only have
to recognize our power

515
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,547
and become skilled
at using it.

516
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:42,341
[knocking at door]

517
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:47,555
CELENE: Sir William Marshal,
Earl of Pembroke, Your Highness.

518
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:52,101
In time...
I will teach you such power.

519
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,859
-Earl.
-My Queen.

520
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,279
-Hope you traveled safely.
-Indeed.

521
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,868
Mm.

522
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,300
Steal the reward money?

523
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,468
If you do, they won't have
enough money to pay the bounty.

524
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,345
-No bounty--
-No bounty hunters.

525
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:30,264
JOHN:
True, no reward,

526
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,724
others won't risk
their necks.

527
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,018
Less men hunting us.

528
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,604
One condition.

529
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,230
You let me stay
with you for now,

530
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:39,648
and my share will go
to the poor.

531
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,650
You agree to this,
or I won't help you.

532
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,736
Fine.

533
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,154
You do what you will with it.

534
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:50,159
The reward will be made up
of the King's taxes.

535
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,077
They're ferried
from Leicester to Nottingham.

536
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,830
They always stop
at Stafford's Mill

537
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,416
to rest the horses.
You can surprise them there.

538
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,668
We get caught,
they'll string us up.

539
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,003
Well, we're already
marked for that

540
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,755
so what's the difference?

541
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,757
And Mary's been hung already.

542
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,760
Rope weren't strong enough
to break her neck.

543
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,431
I'd say the King owes me.

544
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,143
Let's go to Stafford's Mill.

545
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,478
[clearing throat]

546
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,816
Tuck, how many men does
the Bishop travel with?

547
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,152
Uh...

548
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,738
two clerks
and two soldiers.

549
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:30,032
Are you sure?

550
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,950
Yes.

551
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,535
It's never been more.

552
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,746
No one's ever been fool enough
to rob the Bishop.

553
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:37,873
Till now.

554
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:43,754
If you shoot
one of the soldiers in the leg,

555
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:46,215
-the other will scare off.
-Not sure it'll be that easy.

556
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,634
What's it matter anyway?
They're Norman soldiers.

557
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,427
That doesn't make them evil.

558
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:52,221
They serve the same evil.

559
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,264
Their kind murdered my father.

560
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:56,767
Whatever befalls them,
they've brought onto themselves.

561
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,686
And what would your father
to such reasoning?

562
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,397
He would say,
"Listen to your mother,"

563
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,482
who would say,
"You sound like a fool, Rob."

564
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:07,695
And what your Godda say?

565
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,324
She'd say kill them all.

566
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,965
[door creaking]

567
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,349
[neighing]

568
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:39,727
-PRISCILLA: Ha!
-[horse neighing]

569
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,612
-MARSHAL: New one?
-QUEEN: From Nottingham.

570
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,532
The Sheriff's daughter,
Priscilla?

571
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,909
-I'm not that foolish.
-I hear the Sheriff's daughter

572
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,494
is quite spirited.

573
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:59,163
Just your type then.

574
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,665
No, this one's
the Earl of Huntingdon's girl.

575
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:02,916
Huntingdon.

576
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:07,129
Blunt axe,
good in battle.

577
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:10,382
-Where is he now?
-A sheep farmer, I believe.

578
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:13,469
[chuckling] Which I'm certain
doesn't suit his temperament.

579
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,597
Let's hope not.
Restless men are useful.

580
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,558
So, you're grooming a new spy.

581
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,601
Can a queen have too many?

582
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:24,772
Tell me about my husband.
How is he?

583
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:28,233
Oh, I thought you'd ask me
about the King's mistress first.

584
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,487
I'm more interested
in his health.

585
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,157
Or rather any indication
it might be failing.

586
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,827
[neighing]

587
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:05,854
[neighing]

588
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,571
Blueberry?
There was a mess back there.

589
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:18,033
Thank you.

590
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,285
These are good.

591
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:23,747
The flower.
Reminds you of someone?

592
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:25,582
Uh, yes, um...

593
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:28,710
daughter of a Norman lord.

594
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:31,713
You killed a Norman captain

595
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:32,965
and slept with
another Norman's daughter?

596
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,133
No, I didn't sleep with her.

597
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,220
Where is she now?

598
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,097
Uh-- London.

599
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,266
Is she coming back?

600
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,517
I don't know.

601
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:47,396
If she doesn't...

602
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,356
just means there's someone
out there better for you, Rob.

603
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:58,156
[bell tolling]

604
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:04,788
[sheep bleating]

605
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,727
[clinking]

606
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,234
This is everything,
Your Eminence.

607
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,030
You two.

608
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,656
Have extra men accompany us,

609
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,034
and see that the carriage is
ready in the morning to leave.

610
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,710
How do we know they'll come?

611
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,671
Because tomorrow is
the last day of the month.

612
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:57,049
They always collect the taxes
on the last day.

613
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,550
SPRAGART: Don't you know
that's tomorrow?

614
00:36:58,634 --> 00:36:59,760
He's a monk.

615
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,637
Monks use the Julian calendar
to count the days.

616
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:03,305
It's named after Julius Caesar.

617
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,350
You're schooled.

618
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,060
By my mother's hand.

619
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,645
Our Rob's a proper nobleman.

620
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,647
And what if they don't
stop to rest?

621
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,940
No, we'll make sure they stop.

622
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:14,733
We'll put a log
across the river.

623
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:18,570
-It will float away.
-Not a rotten one.

624
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:20,822
Hollow and weighed down
with rocks.

625
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,574
Like catching eels.

626
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:24,117
Cunning.

627
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:27,788
[rhythmic panting]

628
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,919
[rhythmic panting continues]

629
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,505
[moaning]

630
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:43,845
So...

631
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,014
is it true?

632
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,519
Just tell me.

633
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,854
Yes, it's true.

634
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,650
Leicester would support
the Queen's rebellion.

635
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,944
York too, I suspect.

636
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,445
The problem is Nottingham.

637
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:05,659
Of course,
the Sheriff will always side

638
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:06,994
with the King.

639
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,623
They're blood...
[gasping]

640
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,717
That's why Eleanor is
grooming a new spy.

641
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,760
Plucked straight
from Nottingham.

642
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:29,766
She's a maid.

643
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:31,977
Makes her
all the more fun.

644
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,732
[moaning]

645
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,529
[door slamming shut]

646
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,031
WILL:
Well, that was a lot of fun.

647
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:45,949
[laughter]

648
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,326
I must say, you two ladies
certainly have a lot of energy.

649
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,746
[laughter]

650
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,749
Ladies.

651
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,626
[laughter]

652
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,259
Marian!

653
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,178
What are you doing out here?

654
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,138
Enjoying the stars.

655
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,433
Well...

656
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,268
there certainly are
more interesting things

657
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,562
to enjoy than stargazing.

658
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,983
Really?

659
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:21,443
Like raiding
the Queen's cellar

660
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,737
and chasing her servants?

661
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,156
Let me guess.

662
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,741
You miss the forest.

663
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,870
Not everyone loves
palaces and grand halls

664
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,288
as much as you, Will.

665
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,542
Well, it doesn't matter
that I love them.

666
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:39,294
It matters that I'm in them.

667
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:49,513
Nottingham was
a fine place to begin life.

668
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,432
But I suppose...

669
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:53,975
you and I...

670
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,811
we weren't meant to stay.

671
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:01,233
Yet my heart remains
in Sherwood.

672
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,946
I told you,

673
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,948
you would do well
to forget Rob.

674
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,369
For your own sake.

675
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:16,414
That's the problem with love.

676
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,418
You stop doing things
for your own sake.

677
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,173
You sound quite...

678
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,676
tragic, Marian.

679
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,810
Are you sure I can't help
provide you a little remedy?

680
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,572
Good night, Will.

681
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,323
[soft chuckle]

682
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:53,577
Good night, Marian.

683
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,499
[sighing]

684
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,065
What were you praying for?

685
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,739
That our actions may
bring about some good.

686
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:35,243
But I'm not sure
God will hear me.

687
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:38,663
Perhaps I must accept
what we're about to do.

688
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:41,082
-Make peace with it.
-Peace?

689
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,501
I saw my father try
to live in peace.

690
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,212
And the Normans hanged him.

691
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,464
How is peace possible?

692
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,257
Christ shows us how.

693
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,384
He teaches us
to love our enemy.

694
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:54,304
Do good to those
who hate us.

695
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,932
[speaking Latin]

696
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,350
You know your Bible.

697
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:00,435
Eh, it's not my Bible.

698
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,354
It's the book of my enemy.

699
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,105
I am not your enemy.

700
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,615
Why did they hang
your father?

701
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,825
They say he killed a man,
but he didn't.

702
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,035
He couldn't have.

703
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,539
-And you blame the Sheriff?
-Who else?

704
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,377
And I'll have my revenge.

705
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,087
And that'll make you happy?

706
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,838
It'll make things right.

707
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,384
Lex talionis,
"Eye for an eye."

708
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,677
Also your Bible.

709
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,512
And still
that same book says,

710
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:37,472
"'Do not repay evil with evil.

711
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,432
Vengeance is mine,'
says the Lord."

712
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:44,229
Revenge will bring no good.

713
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,731
You've already spilled blood.

714
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:48,817
Do you feel better?

715
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,444
It would be the same
with the Sheriff.

716
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:53,822
You could kill him
a thousand times over,

717
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,157
it would never fill
the hole in your heart.

718
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,159
Vengeance will not heal you.

719
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:05,208
[door opening]

720
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:16,177
You were to be
at the convent by now.

721
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:17,846
Did you think
I would simply comply?

722
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,347
Yes!

723
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:20,974
Well, think again, Father.

724
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:22,142
You defy me?

725
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,565
Don't turn your back on me,
how dare you.

726
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,695
How dare you.

727
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,613
I am your father.

728
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,490
And I am your daughter.

729
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:40,035
Yet you send me off
with that gluttonous snake

730
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,662
and decide my future
without so much as a word to me.

731
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:46,124
For your own good.
For your protection.

732
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:50,378
-[chair scraping]
-Besides, it is my right...

733
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:52,839
to decide your future.

734
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,799
By the laws of this land,

735
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:57,385
by the hand
of the King himself.

736
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:59,054
You're right.

737
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:05,268
Now... I turn my back
on you, Father.

738
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,980
-Sire.

739

-Drop the knife!
-Drop it!

740
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,568
-No, Milange!
-Get him!

741
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,195
Milange, stop.

743
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:21,910

[water babbling]

748
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,083
Here they come.

749
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,137
-Two? You said--
-There's always two.

750
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,222
Always has been.

751
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,015
That's half a dozen
with the driver,

752
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,517
-that's--
-That's too many.

753
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,810

755
00:45:37,694 --> 00:45:39,654
TUCK: They can't see
all the soldiers.

756
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,948
Please let them pass.
Please let them pass.

Let me see, let me see.
Move, move, move.

771
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,312
I need to see it.

772
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,939
-You're gonna be okay.
-RALPH: Henry!

773
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,607

-Please.

-Have mercy.
-You can beg to Mary.

781
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:51,619
Her dead body will be
the last thing you see.

782
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:52,954
Enough!

783
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,498
Let him go.

784
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:01,671
You killed soldiers.
King's men.

785
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,756
You're damned.
All of you damned!

786

Damned by who, Bishop?

-Who are you?
-He's "Rob in the Hood."

788

I swear by God Almighty,

790
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:20,064
you and your ragged bunch
will be brought to justice.

No.

792
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:24,485
It's you, Bishop,
who will be brought to justice.

793
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:26,321
But today, run.

794
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:27,864
Go and tell the Sheriff

795
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,699
I claim his reward.

796

What happened?

811
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:36,974
Tell me.

In the forest.

Devil?

00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:47,860
By what name?

Answer me.
