1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,373
We got to get the bourbon going,

2
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:08,542
and we got to get our booze
delivered off-board

3
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:09,943
until we get our license back.

4
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:11,379
[Goodie]
We distribute the way they did

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,746
back during Prohibition.

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,515
* exciting, intense music *

7
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,152
-There will be blowback, sir.
-Fix it. You fix it.

8
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:20,288
-There will be blowback!
-You fix it.

9
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:22,923
Do you want to make me proud?

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,158
Yeah.

11
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,693
Then you got to finish this.

12
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:28,829
That guy-- he, um...
did he ever come back around?

13
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:29,897
-No.
-Good.

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,133
I did something right.

15
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,702
Let's talk about
this booze thing.

16
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,337
I want a share.

17
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,971
[Dwight]
See, everything you fucking take

18
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:40,474
that's not yours,
you take and you take

19
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,110
like a fucking animal.

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,145
If I want to get to you
or anybody,

21
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:47,548
it's done, and don't you ever
fucking forget that.

22
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,683
-[gun cocks]
-Down!

23
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:52,553
-[gunfire]
-[patrons screaming]

24
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,825
[Quiet Ray]
You fucking cocksucker.

25
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,793
-You're dead!
-That was meant for me!

26
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,397
* exciting, intense music *

27
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:07,235
[buzzing]

28
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,777
* low, tense music *

29
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,114
All that was meant for me.

30
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:21,515
So what are you saying?

31
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:23,083
-You saw this coming?
-[Dwight] No.

32
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,652
Why would I put you
in that kind of situation?

33
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,054
What sense does that make?

34
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:28,656
It makes no sense.
So let me tell you something.

35
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,258
It's been a long time
since someone

36
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,459
tried to whack me.

37
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,493
Accidentally.

38
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,761
"Accidentally."

39
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,729
You know,
no matter how you word it,

40
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:37,631
it still leads to death.

41
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,633
What do you expect me to say?

42
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,634
I expect you to shut up
and listen.

43
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:42,970
I sat down with you

44
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:44,972
and tried to talk,
and what do you do?

45
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:47,775
You accuse me of-of-of
whacking what's-his-name?

46
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,410
You know his name, Ray.

47
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,213
Look, I don't give a fuck
what his name is.

48
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:53,447
The fact is,

49
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,115
you brought that prick up

50
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:56,750
and it fucked the negotiating.

51
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,286
[Dwight]
Demanding 80%

52
00:01:58,419 --> 00:01:59,652
or else?

53
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,389
That's not a negotiation.

54
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:02,956
[Quiet Ray] Look, what do you
want from me, anyway?

55
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,259
[Dwight] I want to finish
the business we started.

56
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:06,760
I want to cut you in on this

57
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,628
-liquor concern, you know?
-Cut me in?

58
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:11,165
You sound like you're giving me
a Christmas gift or something.

59
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:13,867
This is something
that you should just do.

60
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,605
Hey, this is gonna pay off
for both of us.

61
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,006
Yeah? How's that?

62
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,275
Look, I want to get
into the clubs,

63
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:22,910
the hotels, retailers,

64
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:26,214
which means I need access
to the Northeast.

65
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:30,584
And whatever pull you have
in Atlantic City, Las Vegas--

66
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:31,985
And what about our deal?

67
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,388
I can't. It's out of
the fucking question.

68
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,090
Come on. There's enough
to go around for all of us,

69
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:39,126
for-for Christ's sake.

70
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,094
You got to be reasonable.

71
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:42,329
You got some

72
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,665
fucking balls on you,
you know that?

73
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,501
All right, we'll put off
the deal for another day,

74
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,537
but let me tell you something
right now.

75
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,605
That day is gonna come,

76
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,675
and it's gonna come very soon,
you understand me?

77
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,010
Yeah, I understand.

78
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,712
Good.

79
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,414
All right.

80
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,083
I'll help you.

81
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,720
[phone beeps]

82
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,862
What'd he say?

83
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,430
Eh, not that much.

84
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,234
He didn't discuss numbers
or terms or anything like that.

85
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:26,374
He's gonna whack me.

86
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,876
Matter of time.

87
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,913
Dunmire's after you as well.

88
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,882
Masked or not, disguised or not,

89
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,285
we know it was them
in Hot Springs.

90
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,253
So what's the play?

91
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,088
First thing you got to do
is get that seal

92
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,923
off the distillery.
That's a priority.

93
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,825
How we gonna do that?

94
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,227
Some people need a wake-up call.

[Dwight chuckles]

100
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:01,635
You seem to be lost in thought.

101
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,504
Are you kind of thinking
about something here?

102
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,205
Well, Tyson...

103
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,807
is he not driving you anymore?

104
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,075
Uh, well, sometimes.

105
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,110
Yeah. He's trying
to broaden his horizons.

106
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,912
Listen, he wants to be
an earner.

107
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,246
That's understandable.

108
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:15,483
Sure. Why not?

109
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,084
And you...

110
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,218
Mr. Chuckles,

111
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,920
are you happy with your job?

112
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:20,988
Too happy.

113
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,623
[chuckles]

114
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,426
-[Bigfoot] This close enough?
-Yeah, it's close enough.

115
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,897
* upbeat music *

116
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,034
Let's do this.

117
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,038
No. Wait, wait, wait.
You stay here.

118
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,272
I got to be discreet.

119
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:41,375
-In that suit?
-Yeah.

120
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,510
Hey, boss.

121
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:43,844
They got metal detectors.

122
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:44,845
Fuck.

123
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,547
-Come on, come on.
-Here.

124
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:47,848
See?

125
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,282
All right.

126
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,530

-[alarm blares]
-Ooh, ooh.

130
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,377
Can I get you to come
right here, sir?

131
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,413
-Mm-hmm.
-Turn around for me, please.

132
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,051
Must be the brass balls.
[chuckles]

133
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,988
[wand whining]

134
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,390
You want to remove
your belt buckle, sir?

135
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:32,259
It's kind of small.

136
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,263
-Yeah.
-It's like a house pet.

137
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,230
[laughs]

Mr. Manfredi.

143
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,078
[Dwight]
How are you?

144
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,046
Uh, whatever is
discussed here today

145
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,584
will be held
in the strictest confidence.

146
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,284
Always.

147
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,154
There's no shame in crying uncle

148
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,924
when all the odds are stacked
against you.

149
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:07,360
Is that an insult,
Attorney General?

150
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,596
No.

151
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:11,198
Look... [chuckles]

152
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:15,035
Jeremiah Dunmire...
I mean, you're-you're not naive.

153
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,937
Now, he's a force of nature
round here,

154
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,772
round these parts.

155
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,441
So, what, um...

156
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:25,112
what message would you like me
to pass along?

157
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,781
I'd like you to listen to me

158
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,416
very carefully.

159
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,284
You're in power

160
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,054
because of that crazy bastard.

161
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,825
That crazy bastard's in power

162
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:41,595
because of who resides
in the governor's mansion.

163
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:44,464
But that won't be for long.

164
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,133
It won't? [chuckles]

165
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,702
Well, that's news to me.

166
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,005
You know,
I'm gonna build you a path.

167
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,643
A path built on trust.

168
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,145
But I'm gonna need
one small favor.

169
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,247
I'm gonna need
your friends down at

170
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,350
the Alcoholic Beverage
Law Enforcement Commission

171
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:07,087
to restore my sister's
liquor license,

172
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,191
which was taken away

173
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,527
without any real reason.

174
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,829
And if you do that,

175
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:19,299
I'm gonna be in debt to you,
and that's a good thing to have,

176
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,935
a good chip to have.

177
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,004
Because I can do things

178
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,840
that other people can't

179
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:28,742
or just won't.

180
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,679
It's time for you to leave, sir.

181
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:35,683
The first time
I arrive somewhere,

182
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:39,953
I try to make
the most favorable presentation.

183
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,722
The second...

184
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,124
not so much.

185
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:47,227
* low, tense music *

186
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,330
You have no idea
who this man is.

187
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:55,135
I know exactly who he is.

188
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,705
Exactly.

189
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,308
This is very nice.

190
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,579
Lawman of the Year.

191
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,889
Good day, Mr. Manfredi.

192
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:18,491
It's a little early to tell.

193
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,362
[door closes]

194
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,947
What's wrong?

195
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:43,250
He won't talk to me.

196
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:44,652
My old man.

197
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:47,320
You're lucky I'm talking to you.

198
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,657
After what you did
at the distillery.

199
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,759
I know.

200
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:55,295
I do things for him
I know are wrong,

201
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,597
but I do 'em anyway.

202
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,001
Fuck.

203
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:06,173
There's something else I did
that went wrong.

204
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,576
What did you do?

205
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,479
I don't want to say something
that'll push you away.

206
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:16,116
Do you know what would happen

207
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,786
if they all knew
I was here with you right now?

208
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,420
I know.

209
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:22,255
And I'm sorry.

210
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,624
* somber music *

211
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,795
No, I just...

212
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,863
I really like you.

213
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,934
And when I'm with you, I...

214
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,142
What do you want to say, Cole?

215
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,346
I feel like
everything's gonna be okay.

216
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,985
And I don't want
to fuck that up.

217
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,260
-[pop music playing quietly]
-[door opens]

218
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,398
[Tyson] Yo, I got to ask you
a question, man.

219
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,735
What was your first hustle?

220
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,169
Stolen newspapers.

221
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,204
I sold 'em on the F train.
Think I was eight.

222
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,472
No, man, no.

223
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,974
I'm talking about
as a grown man now.

224
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,242
Like, what did you do

225
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,810
when you first
got to get into it?

226
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:19,312
I shook down a guy
who owned a shoe store.

227
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:20,413
Easy money.

228
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,115
[laughs] You shook down...

229
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:24,517
That's a cold motherfucker
right there.

230
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,520
Hey, look, man,
it ain't rocket science.

231
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,556
All right? It's all about
supply and demand.

232
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,459
What do people demand,
and how could you supply it?

233
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,661
-That's it.
-Yeah.

234
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,663
You could become a cop.

235
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:38,365
[laughs] Fuck out of here, man.

236
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,600
No. Damn. What's going on?

237
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,634
Fake cop.

238
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,103
-Fake cop.
-Right?

239
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,072
You steal from bad guys
and give to good guys.

240
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,040
Like fucking Robin Hood.

241
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:47,975
I like that.

242
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,509
I used to raid a joint,

243
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,011
rob 'em blind, clear them out.

244
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,512
They couldn't call it in.

245
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,915
-They couldn't report it.
-What?

246
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,517
Real drug deal--
Real kingpins and shit?

247
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,888
Back in the day, yeah. But you
stick to people your own age,

248
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,923
-these college kids.
-Mm.

249
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,224
What are they into?

250
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,526
These kids are
crazy as fuck, man.

251
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,163
You know, they like Molly,
Xan, Perc, um...

252
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,632
I don't know, man. It's been
a minute since my campus days,

253
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,534
-to be honest with you.
-There's a market there.

254
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,237
-It's good, so...
-It is, yeah.

255
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,639
There's a market there.

256
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,410
Here come my little
college connection right here.

257
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,245
You onto something.
Hey, Spencer.

258
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,614
[clears throat] Got a little
business proposition for you.

259
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,282
-Is that a fact?
-Yeah, it's fact.

260
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,851
Come here. Let me holla at you.

261
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,353
[phone buzzing]

262
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,760
-Hey.
-[Dwight] Hey, Margaret.

263
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:44,531
Do you know anyone in
the attorney general's office?

264
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,066
Uh, I know him socially.

265
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,901
-I know his wife.
-Christ, really?

266
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:50,737
Is there anyone you don't know?
I could use a political favor.

267
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,472
Yeah.

268
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,374
So what's in it for me?

269
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,642
Ah.

270
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,710
What kind of guy
do you think I am, huh?

271
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:00,380
I scratch your back,
you scratch mine.

272
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,582
Don't we already
do that for free?

273
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,151
Guess that's true.

274
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,419
[Spencer]
All right, pull over here.

275
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,894
[engine shuts off]

276
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,463
This frat,
they supply most of the campus

277
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,431
-and a lot of Tulsa.
-[Tyson] You sure?

278
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,400
A hundred percent.
I party with them.

279
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,768
Trust-fund kids.

280
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:24,337
Oil-money douchebags
who love rolling on E.

281
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:25,505
This is the spot.

282
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:26,907
Sounds promising.

283
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,541
Yo, let's bust a move.
[clears throat]

284
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,011
Easy, cowboy.
We got to do recon.

285
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,846
The fuck are you talking about?

286
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,315
I-- My ass is on the line
with Dwight, bro.

287
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,950
Come on, man,
don't got no time for this

288
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:39,319
"Oh, this is what
the boss wants"-ass bullshit.

289
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,820
When you paint a room,

290
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,322
-you got to do...
-Oh, my...

291
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,456
-...your prep work first.
-[groans] Here he goes

292
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,225
with this shit.

293
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,995
-How 'bout I do it?
-I don't know.

294
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:49,296
What experience
do you have, uh--

295
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,630
Getting into frat houses?

296
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,599
[Tyson chuckling]

297
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,401
More than anyone here.

298
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,469
[Goodie]
All right.

299
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:57,804
Tomorrow, then.

300
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,873
Tomorrow? How 'bout right now?

301
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,509
Easy. I got to get the badges.

302
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,645
And I'm gonna need to know
the number of guys in there,

303
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,247
how to get into the basement

304
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,382
and if there's a guard dog.

305
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:13,486
That last one is very,
very important.

306

-[piano music plays quietly]
-[indistinct chatter]

307
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,461
-Margaret. [chuckles]
-Hi.

308
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:24,031
-It's been a minute, huh?
-I know.

309
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:25,032
-Mm.
-Ah.

310
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,533
Oh, it's so lovely to see you.

311
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,201
Great to see you, too, Anna.

312
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,437
And thank you for coming
all the way out here.

313
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,672
Oh, you didn't have
to twist my arm.

314
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,707
I love this place.

315
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,377
The people-watching alone
is worth it.

316
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,079
Thank you.

317
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:42,015
Lot of people prancing
around here-- ooh--

318
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,750
like they're somebody important.

319
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:44,817
[laughs]

320
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:46,453
Well, most of them are.

321
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,388
At least in Tulsa.

322
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,223
The hubby keeps saying
that we're gonna apply

323
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:53,193
for membership,
but like they say,

324
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,828
if I had a dime
for every broken promise...

325
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:57,630
Well, it is pricey.

326
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,566
-I'll give you that.
-Yeah.

327
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,935
Well, he's a public servant now,

328
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:05,405
so there's no more
law firm perks and bonuses.

329
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,241
Yeah, but, Anna...
attorney general?

330
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,811
Come on. That's a stepping stone
towards higher office, right?

331
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,080
[chuckles]

332
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,747
Yes. Maybe.

333
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,882
[chuckles]

334
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:17,450
Well, I don't know.

335
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:20,087
Higher office, higher scrutiny.

336
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,955
You don't like the spotlight.

337
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,423
No, I actually don't mind that.

338
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:24,691
[both laugh]

339
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:25,858
It's just...

340
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,828
You know, other things.

341
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,597
Do you want to get a drink?

342
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,832
'Cause I could sure use one.

343
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,135
-Or two.
-[laughs]

344
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,836
And, Anna...

345
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,272
anything we talk about today,

346
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,807
you know me.

347
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,109
I'm a vault.

348
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,111

[rock music playing quietly]

350
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:48,881
Hello.

351
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,518
Her marriage has problems,

352
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,953
and she's explaining them to me.

353
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,722
At length.

354
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,125
Well, let's hear it.

355
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,826
That's good.

356
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,362
You know,
you're pretty good at this.

357
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,998
I think you'd be a natural
as a spy.

358
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,968
Thresher owes you big-time.

359
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,837
So do I.

360

361

[vehicle door closes]

362
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,502
[Dwight]
There she is.

363
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,171
[Thresher over TV] ...stand up
for real Oklahomans...

364
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,473
[Dwight] I didn't know
you had cartoons here.

365
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:47,974
[laughs] Oh.

366
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:51,010
-Can I get you a water?
-Nah, I'm good. Thank you.

367
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,912
All right, let's do this fast.

368
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,547
[Dwight]
Listen, we could have met you

369
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,116
-at your house.
-Oh, yeah.

370
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,584
You'd blend right in.

371
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:58,818
Look,

372
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,054
I don't put anything
past Dunmire

373
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,522
and his puppet incumbent.

374
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,022
We're moving up,
and they're getting agitated.

375
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:07,827
I went to see the AG.
He wasn't buying my deal.

376
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,797
He does realize
that's his problem, right?

377
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,465
Dwight, I told you:
the Sicilian hustle

378
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,967
doesn't work down here.

379
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:17,637
You don't know
the political culture of Tulsa.

380
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,573
They just like working
with their own.

381
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,842
Why do you think I'm here?

382
00:17:22,974 --> 00:17:25,444
Why rock the boat,
for shit's sake? Right?

383
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,348
[stammers] You can bust my balls
as soon as I get elected.

384
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,151
Can you believe
how fucking rude this guy is?

385
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,919
Let me explain something.
Do you remember

386
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:36,223
we had a conversation that
we'd pick up where we left off?

387
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:37,790
[Thresher]
Exactly. Dwight,

388
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,226
my polling is up.

389
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,861
My Q scores among likely voters
has doubled.

390
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,564
I got a real shot at this thing,
so why would I risk it all

391
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,267
to curry favor with some AG
on your behalf?

392
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:50,137
-Margaret.
-Then do it on your behalf.

393
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,771
Make it about you.

394
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,573
Building relationships.

395
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:54,907
Relation--

396
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,509
He's Dunmire's guy,
and you both know that.

397
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,711
Yeah, but he's also
the governor's guy.

398
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:01,448
And if you can pull
the AG away from the governor,

399
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:02,882
which I think you can,

400
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,952
maybe even get him
to endorse you...

401
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,255
-[Dwight] Mm-hmm.
-...that would be a coup.

402
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,190
And yeah,
your numbers are improving,

403
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,625
but a move like that
could put you over the top.

404
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,093
[Dwight]
Win one for yourself.

405
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,296
Man, you got to strike
while the iron is hot,

406
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,165
-am I right?
-[Margaret] Right.

407
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,400
Have a meeting for you.

408
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,702
Matter of fact, have a fucking
meeting at my place.

409
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,305
-It might bring you luck.
-At your place?

410
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,808
I mean, not the most enchanting
place to win a guy's favor.

411
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,277
[Margaret]
I think Bred-2-Buck's perfect.

412
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,811
Sets the right tone.

413
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,112
Yes.

but also...

man of the people.

416
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,219
Oh, now you're pushing it.

417
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,520
[Dwight]
No.

418
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:43,423
That's what I do, Cal.

419
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,124
Hey, let's shake.

420
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:46,826
Before I break it.

You think she good in there?

422
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,831
Yeah, what, are they gonna
force her to do a keg stand?

423
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,133
-You got the badges, right?
-Of course.

424
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,969
Oh, fuck.

425
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,071
Oh, shit.

426
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:00,507
How you come up on this, bro?

427
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,475
-I know a motivated seller.
-Hell yeah.

428

They-they-they look
real as fuck.

429
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,078
Of course they are.

430
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:09,349
[Tyson]
Oh, here she comes, right here.

431
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,657
What's the word?

432
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,792
Six guys in the common area
playing Xbox.

433
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:22,529
A couple looked high, the other
two just looked pretty lame.

on the left.

-Good.

00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,637
-You finally ready to do this?
-Yes.

437
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,104
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

438
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,106
-I want to go with you.
-Wh-What? No way.

439
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:35,942

-But I want 50% of the gross.

00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:29,742
Coming right up.

531
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:32,344
Hope I'm not pulling you
over to the dark side.

532
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:35,147
Nah, a little day drinking
never hurt anybody.

[Thresher]
Mm.

537
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:53,900
You know, I've been

538
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,301
watching your career
with admiration.

539
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:56,536
[Sackrider]
Really? I had no idea.

540
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:58,137
[Thresher]
Oh, sure.

541
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,772
I mean, what you did
with those gang members

542
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:01,474
in Oklahoma City,
that was some old-school

543
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,309
justice,
meted out with a firm hand.

544
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:05,411
All in service of
the good people of Oklahoma.

545
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:07,980
Oh, well, amen to that.

547
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:14,253
I've been putting a lot

I intend to win.

[Thresher]
Mm-mm.

551
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:20,326
It's about having the power
to get things done.

552
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,661
[Mitch]
Easy does it.

553
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,062
[Thresher]
...affect real change.

554
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:26,365
That's why I want you
on our team.

00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:32,805
Why not reap the benefits
of my PAC's contributions?

557
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:34,473
And all you have to do in return

558
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:36,075
-is to endorse me.
-Look, I'm...

559
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:37,710
I'm flattered and honored,
but no.

560
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:39,646

he'd be in his DNA.

-[Thresher] ...change your mind?
-[Sackrider] I am not one...

[Mitch]
There she goes.

563
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,185
We don't usually get
such esteemed guests

564
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,286
here at the Bred-2-Buck.

565
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:49,155

-any of our gaming options.
-Wow.

568
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:55,562
Well, uh, thank you, young lady.

569
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,063
[quietly]
You son of a bitch.

570
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,531
-Come on, Cal.
-Oh, no, no. No.

571
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,567
No, not you. I was thinking
of somebody else.

572
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,001
You know what?

573
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,636
-Let's just change the subject.
-[Margaret] Nice.

574
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:04,671
[Sackrider] Why not just
spend the house's money,

575
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:05,538
call it a day?

576
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:06,472
No hard feelings.

577
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:07,840
None whatsoever.

00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:09,709

Oh. Yes, sir.

-[Dwight chuckles]
-[Margaret] There we go.

585
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,154
[Dwight]
Hook, line and sinker.

586
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,824
He's like a wind-up toy.

587
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:27,359
Shit.

588
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,962
Is that who I think it is?

589
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:31,397
[Dwight]
Yeah.

590
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:34,601
Let's go.

591
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,168
Nah, I'll take care of this.
I got it.

592
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,737
You sure?
He's got his people with him.

593
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,372
Yeah, I know.
But he won't do anything here.

594
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,341
Bigfoot.

595
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,216
[Jeremiah]
Ah, look at these guys.

596
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,585
[birds singing]

597
00:25:57,523 --> 00:25:59,692
You guys lost?

598
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,994
You pay a visit
to my attorney general,

599
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:04,330
you think
he's not gonna call me?

600
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,399
I expected that.

601
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,101
[Jeremiah]
So you're trying to bait me.

602
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,803
Raise my ire.

603
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:12,872
[Dwight] You know
there's an ancient book

604
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,975
called The Art of War?

605
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,543
It's a military theses

606
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:21,080
that was written in
the fifth or sixth century BC.

607
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,149
I'm sure you're not familiar
with it.

608
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,617
Any of you guys?

609
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:27,386
What's that got to do
with a goddamn thing?

610
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:29,622
[Dwight] It's got
everything to do with it,

611
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,457
because it's
all about your enemy:

612
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:35,427
learning about them, their
strengths, their weaknesses.

613
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:37,329
But it also says,

614
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:40,967
"Build your fucking enemy
a golden bridge

615
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,369
so they can escape

616
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,104
and save face."

617
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,740
[Jeremiah]
You want an off-ramp, Manfredi?

618
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,275
Ask for it.

619
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:51,477
I built you a bridge, Dunmire.

620
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,945
Use it.

621
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,346
The balls on you.

622
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,348
You got no way
to distill or distribute,

623
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:57,784
and you won't have one.

624
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,285
I control the law.

625
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:01,153
[Dwight]
And the governor.

626
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:03,856
For now.

627
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,557
You know, the thing
about people...

628
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:06,793
[snaps fingers]

629
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,828
...they change overnight.

630
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:10,697
People don't change.

631
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:12,865
And if they do, well...

632
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:18,037
You stay away from my people.

633
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:21,007
Or I'll bury you next.

634
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,374
Mm.

635
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:24,343
Use the bridge, Dunmire.

636
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,778
[Jeremiah laughs]

637
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:28,114

-Hey!
-Hard eight!

641
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:38,357
Oh, yeah, baby. Hard eights.

642
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,193
That'll play.
I'll take eights all night long.

643
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,595
So what's your long-term plan?

644
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:44,897
Oh...

645
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:47,499
to make... [chuckles]
...some money.

646
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:48,868
Professionally.

647
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,636
I'll be looking for
a lieutenant governor

648
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:52,338
that I can trust.

649
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:56,408
Wow. You're pretty handy
around these tables.

650
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,878
[exhales] Don't tell my wife.

651
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:00,179
Oh...

652
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:02,281
I'm pretty good
at keeping a secret.

653
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:06,352
-Yes, sir!

-[muffled music playing]
-[muffled chatter]

655
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,959
[Dwight]
I like to gamble.

656
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,327
-But not with money.
-Mm.

657
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,663
Mm, you gamble on people.

658
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:18,865
I do.

659
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:21,633
I try to figure out
their next move.

660
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,235
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

661
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:24,503
Do you know what my next move

662
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,138
-is gonna be?
-Yeah, of course.

663
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:28,007
"Of course"?

664
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,508
We got to stay focused, okay?

665
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,043
What? I am!
What did you mean?

666
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:32,078
Well, you're pretty obvious,

667
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:33,279
-let's face it.
-Oh--

668
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,246
Grace.

We are on a roll, Cal.

00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:08,447
Hey. You know, you, uh...

675
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,082
you might want to quit
while you're ahead.

676
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:13,619
No, I'm playing
with the house's money.

There's no downside here.

00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,999
Shit. Well...

680
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:29,701
-Yeah. Shit.
-[Sackrider] Yeah.

681
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:30,837
Can't win 'em all.

682
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,238
All right.

683
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,706
Let's come back out.

684

Two crap, crap dice.

Oh, boy.

-Look, you know, maybe--
-Don't change the mood, Cal.

[slams chips on table]

688
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,731
Show me some midnight.
Show me some...

689
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:03,035
Colt .45, anything...
anything, anything but Big Red.

-Son of a... bitch!
-Three, crap dice.

692

-[patrons groan]
-Oh...

Three, crap three.
That's crap dice.

695
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:26,225
Mr. Sackrider, based on
your standing in the community,

696
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,327
you're preapproved for 100,000.

697
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,295
What?

698
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,965
[rock music playing]

699
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:35,034
Then I guess I have...

700
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,169
-have some pull around here.
-Somebody does.

701
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:38,604
How much of that
line of credit would you

702
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:42,574
-like to draw from, sir?
-Uh... [whimpers softly]

703
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,144
Um...

704
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:47,546
[laughs] All-all of it.

705
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,289
[Thresher]

He's a gambler, Cal.

712

Can't blame you for his vice.

713
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,506
Listen, he wouldn't have
come here for me.

714
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,408
He just needed a nudge from you.

715
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:18,710
A nudge?

716
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:20,779
Have you been
in on this the whole time?

717
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:24,316
Mm, I had a little intel
from his wife, so... yeah.

718
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,186
Look, Governor, I'm gonna
have him in my pocket.

719

in yours.

Can I ask you something?

732
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:17,803
I'm genuinely curious.

733
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:21,107

to embarrass or...

I'm it.

I'm all that's left
