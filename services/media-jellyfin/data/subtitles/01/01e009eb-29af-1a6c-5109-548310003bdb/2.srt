1
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,775
I like that flag.
How much?

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,976
What do you think of my pin?

3
00:00:09,043 --> 00:00:10,644
That's nice.

4
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,546
Got it from a terrorist.

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,317
What type of explosive?

6
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:19,053
I just want to take out
the competition.

7
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:20,321
And the lucky recipient?

8
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:22,290
[Dwight]
Jeremiah...

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,324
Dunmire.

10
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:24,792
That was difficult,

11
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,527
not tearing that guy's head off.

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,029
What you're getting is
a whole lot of justice

13
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,498
for a whole lot of people.

14
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:32,031
Where the contraband at?

15
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:36,070
Hey, Spence, I need to know, can
you really sell this shit fast?

16
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,639
I can sell this shit
in ten minutes.

17
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:41,942
Oh... three, crap three.

18
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,378
[Dwight] You owe the house
a hundred large.

19
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:45,679
I am the house.

20
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,382
I've got your back
if you've got mine.

21
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,184
Don't ever play me
like this again.

22
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,252
Either of you.

23
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:53,053
You restored Manfredi's license.

24
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:56,324
Dwight Manfredi has a code
that you lack.

25
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,392
-[screaming]
-You motherf--

26
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:00,294
Help!

27
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:08,436
* upbeat music *

28
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:15,143
-And just like that...
-Congratulations.

29
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:18,212
Open sesame.

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,449
[chuckles]

31
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:30,258
"From humble beginnings
come great things."

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,428
Yeah.
Good to be back in business.

33
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:37,465
If that Dunmire
show up here again,

34
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,533
he'd better bring
the National Guard.

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,101
You got that right.

36
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:42,970

[lock buzzes]

46
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,140
Get me the hell out of here.

47
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,675
Yes, sir.

48
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:27,981
* I'm trying to carry my cross *

[thunder rumbling]

58
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,527
[Jeremiah] You didn't invite
anybody over, did you?

59
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:14,828
[Cole]
No, sir.

60
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,870
[Jeremiah]
You see this guy before?

61
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,037
[Cole]
No.

62
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,607
* dramatic, suspenseful music *

63
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,047
I have this.

64
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:37,050
Who the hell are you?

65
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,020
Mr. Dunmire,
I do apologize for the visit.

66
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:43,724
Last chance.
Why the hell are you here?

67
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,262
I was sent to kill you.

68
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:00,774
And who, pray tell,
sent you to do that?

69
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:05,346
I believe you know.

70
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:12,052
[rain falling outside]

71
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,955
In my world,

72
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:18,091
trustworthiness is everything,

73
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,761
and he is not trustworthy.

74
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,431
And you were gonna kill me,

75
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:26,667
even though our paths
had never crossed.

76
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,071
That's about as immoral
as it gets, isn't it?

77
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:37,778
Morality is not a factor
in my profession,

78
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,713
but survival is.

79
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,815
Manfredi came to me,

80
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,784
hired me to perform a service,

81
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:47,087
but so clearly loathed me.

82
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:52,259
I suspect he has
ulterior motives,

83
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,162
and that's why I'm here.

84
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:59,500
I'm gonna kill him,
that's for certain.

85
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:05,673
But to destroy other people
in his life...

86
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,709
* slow, sinister music *

87
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:12,380
...that would be my gift to you.

88
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,354
[Jeremiah]
Son, you can leave us now.

89
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,757
[footsteps retreating]

90
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,260
You showed up at the right time.

91
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:32,199

95
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,504
[Margaret]
Right.

96
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:45,839
Put Holloway
at table two, not four.

97
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,909
He's a kingmaker, does not sit
behind the oil lobby.

98
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,409
Faith, family and freedom.

99
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:51,712
[Margaret]
No, no, no.

100
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:52,946
-The financial doc...
-And freedom...

101
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,047
...has got to be in the packet,

102
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,415
otherwise we're screwed.

103
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:56,550
Just check every envelope.

104
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,051
[muttering indistinctly]

105
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,286
[Margaret] I don't care
if it takes ten minutes

106
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,754
or ten years. Bye.

107
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:04,091
No flowers. The podium
cannot look like a funeral.

108
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,395
Just something brighter.
We're selling hope. Thank you.

109
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:09,763
Talk to me.

110
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,432
Confirmations
from DuVernay, Witherspoon,

111
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,301
and Harrison families.
Um, and we're still waiting

112
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,804
on the Pentecostal Coalition
rep to respond.

113
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,272
If the bishop shows, we're fine.

114
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,510
If he doesn't, light a candle
because we're dead.

115
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:28,248
And tell Cal
to stop rewriting his speech.

116
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,416
We've already tested it.

117
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:31,384
I told him.

118
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,621
I'll tell him.

119
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,657
Cal, the speech is so strong,

120
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,225
-and you already know it.
-[Thresher] Thank you.

121
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,993
Don't overthink it.

122
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,562
-Trust me.
-[phone buzzing]

123
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,565
Yeah. You're right.

124
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,335
Hello?

125
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,170
Hey, things good over there?

126
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,540
Yeah, final push.
Checking every detail.

127
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,308
And I can't believe
I'm saying this,

128
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,811
but if all goes well tonight,

129
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:00,213
I think we'll have
a future governor on our hands.

130
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,815
I'm banking on it.

131
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,416
Somehow I don't think
you're gonna need Cal Thresher

132

in your back pocket.

133
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:05,819
It can't hurt, Margaret.

134
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,721
Politicians come in handy,

135
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,757

136
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,661

Miss you.

139
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:23,904
Oh, shit. No wonder
I never got married.

* slow, suspenseful music *

141
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,998
[Margaret]
Keller donated that.

142
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,566
That's gonna be huge.

143
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,702
I'm not sure
the poster's big enough.

144
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,204
Oh, Cal. It's just
not big enough for you.

Answer me.

149
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,403
Are you going
to the Thresher thing tonight?

150
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,939
I wasn't invited.

151
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,206
-Oh, like that ever stopped you?
-Well...

00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,685
I'm ready to make the exchange.

156
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,086
There's a gas station near--

157
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,888
How about if I pick
the time and place?

158
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,990
Is that okay?

159
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,591
Such little faith.

160
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:54,327
I'll send you the address.

Mitch.

163
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:01,969
Yeah?

164
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,603
Get Bigfoot.
We're gonna need backup.

165
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:06,006

Please tell me something good.

168
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,448
He called.
I'm sending him the address.

169
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,251
No, no. No, fuck that.
I set the meeting.

170
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,320
-That's not happening.
-Listen to me.

171
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,090
I got to post up.
I got to put together a team.

172
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,926
This has to be flawless.

173
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,828
It will be.

One night, one party.

Fast turnaround, zero overhead.
Easy money.

178
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,783
I'll handle the invites.

179
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,484
Let's do it.

180
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,160
To what do I owe the pleasure?

Bodhi, my soul brother.

182
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,700
So, look, I got
a little question, right?

183
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,702
Not even a question.
I need the keys.

184
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,705
It's one night.
Controlled, clean.

185
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,540
Big money.

186
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,343
Right to business, huh?

187
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,678
No "Long time, no see.
How are you?

188
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,148
How have you been?"
"Good, Tyson, thanks for asking.

189
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,350
Uh, actually, it's been
a little slow around here.

190
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,684
I've missed you."

191
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:27,520
Anyway, so-so, basically,
so me and Spencer,

192
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:28,989
we come up
on a big Molly connect.

193
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,523
And we gonna need a venue, man.

194
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,859
We need a venue.

195
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:35,695
Just X and some alcohol.
She gonna run point.

196
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:38,398
And that's why
you need my place?

197
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,467
We about to do this
in Bred-2-Buck?

198
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,369
[chuckles] Hell no.
Come on, Bodhi.

199
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,137
It-It's just like
the nitrous, man.

200
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,506
You remember how much you was
earning that night, right?

201
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:49,242
Yeah, I remember
the bruises, too.

202
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,613
What about Dwight?

203
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,549
He can't know about this.

204
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,386
He said he want me to earn,
so this is gonna be it.

205
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,488
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
he didn't mean this.

206
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,990
Come on, Bodhi, man.

207
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,859
H-How else am I supposed to earn
big, fast money? How?

208
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,394
You don't even
got to do nothing, Bodhi.

209
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,062
Dwight ain't gonna find out
about this.

210
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,831
And let's just say he does.
If he does,

211
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,399
then, shit, fuck it, it's on me.

212
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:13,700
Your name is not in it.

213
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:15,602
Blacking them windows.

214
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,371
Nobody got to know.

215
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,709
How did he rope you into this?

216
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,711
Actually...

217
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,214
...it was my idea.

218
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,582
Well, fuck.

219
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:38,458
I take 25% of the door
and even split of the product.

220
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:43,663
I need the keys.

221
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,406
[horn honking]

222
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,279
Great day for a bust, ain't it?

223
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,981
Let's do this.

224
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,582
You got the money?

225
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,584
-In the back.
-Okay.

226
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,753
Wait. Musso.

227
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:08,721
I know what you did.

228
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,223
What-What are you talking about?

229
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,825
You're a Fed, right?

230
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:15,462
Deductive reasoning,
hypotheticals, syllogism.

231
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,097
What?

232
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,332
No? Maybe you should read more.

233
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,800
You'll figure it out.
The thing is,

234
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:24,471
after you looked
at every logical possibility,

235
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:28,241
whatever remains,
no matter how illogical...

236
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,643
...it might be it.

237
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:33,646
So I know you took Bevilaqua

238
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:37,684
and then you made it look
like I did it. No, please,

239
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:41,354
don't talk. We know the truth.
Save your fucking breath.

240
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,690
But here's what
I'd like you to do,

241
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,492
since we're such good friends.

242
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:48,361
Release Bevilaqua

243
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,464
and get me out of this bullshit
that you dragged me into.

244
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:54,034
Yes. He's in.

245
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:58,305
He's in because I wanted him in,

246
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,007
'cause he's a gangster
with no purpose

247
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:04,377
and he was gonna fuck up
your purpose. Yeah?

248
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,713
He stays in
until I say otherwise.

249
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:09,182
It's getting dark. Let's go.

250
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,518
* slow, dramatic music *

251
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:17,991
[Musso]
You go in, make the exchange.

252
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,027
When we know you're clear,
we'll move,

253
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:22,662
-take him down.
-And then what?

254
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:26,699
Then justice is served.
End of story.

255
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:32,039
Yeah. You charge him, you
arraign him, you prosecute him,

256
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,540
and maybe even convict him

257
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,609
if he doesn't get off
on some fucking technicality.

258
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:41,548
How many years before
you put the needle in his arm?

259
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:44,918
How many years
of fucking appeals does he get

260
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,887
while those people
lie rotting in the ground?

261
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,523
That's justice?

262
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,526
It's what my partner
would have wanted.

263
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:58,431
Deacon's a legit target.
He's just old business,

264
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,168
not very high
on the Bureau's priority list.

265
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,270
Then why is he high on yours?

266
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,307
He killed my partner.

267
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:12,946
One of his bombs
outside of Sapulpa.

268
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:14,747
Twenty civilians died.

269
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:19,119
My partner tried to save
as many as he could.

270
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,122
-He didn't make it.
-Come on, John.

271
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,257
You sent me those fucking
pictures for a reason.

272
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:27,760
Women and children.
The sick fuck.

273
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,562
You want justice?

274
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:33,400
-Leave him to me.
-Yeah, well,

275
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:37,637
due process, that's what ensures
a better tomorrow.

276
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,639
Well, that didn't happen
for your partner,

277
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,009
and it didn't happen
for those people.

278
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,479
By the book, okay?

279
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,949
Throw that book
in the fucking fire, would you?

280
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,124
[crickets chirping]

* tense, dramatic music *

282
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:16,376
You picked a hell of a location.

00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:18,645
[Fed over radio]
Your guy's inside.

284
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,480
Arrived 15 minutes ago.

285
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,015
He's waiting.

286
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:25,518
Okay.
Backup's a quarter mile out.

287
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:26,953
Make the exchange,

288
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,821
and then we'll move in
and take this fucker down.

289
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,957
I want you to wear a wire

290
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:33,160
-for insurance.
-Rats wear wires.

291
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,129
You want proof? I'll come out
with a bomb, there's your proof.

292
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,831
This case needs to be airtight.

293
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,000
Wear the fucking thing.

294
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,006
What is this,
a fucking breath mint?

295
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,575
It's state-of-the-art.
Clean sound.

296
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:52,512
Just put it under your collar,
for fuck's sake.

297
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:00,387
When this is over, we're done.

298
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:04,656
If this deal holds,

299
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,194
then we're done.

300
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,029

Don't fuck it up.

What the fuck is this?

309
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,456
There was a disconnect,
Mr. Manfredi.

310
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,458
You asked me to perform
a service for you,

311
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:49,996
but it was obvious
you loathed me.

312
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,732
There was something
personal about it.

Check him for tracking devices.

Didn't expect to be on the
wrong end of the double cross.

What is this static?
That's all I hear.

322

Not coming through.
Give it a second.

Thanks for doing this.

Nice to see you. Thank you
so much for being here tonight.

Thank you very, very much.

Well, Margaret, we sure do make
the political couple.

Well, we're both political,
but we're not a couple.

Oh, I beg to differ.

that you and I are giving off.

-[Thresher] Thank you.

354
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,446
Thank you. Enjoy the night.

355
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,584
You know, uh... I was thinking.

356
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,154
I'd like to bring you
into my administration.

357
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,322
Oh, really?

358
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:30,957
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm. In what role?

359
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:32,792
Oh, you decide.

360
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,962
That's very flattering, Cal.

361
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:38,164
Oh, this has nothing to do
with flattery.

362
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,900
This is survival,
so why don't we stop pretending?

363
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,969
What does Dwight want from me?

364
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:44,904
Maybe nothing.

365
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,506
Oh, you know better.

366
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:49,008
-That's between you and Dwight.
-Oh, no, no.

367
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:53,245
That's between the three of us,
and you sure as shit know that.

368
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,280
[chuckles]

369
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:55,815
See, I didn't sign up for this.

370
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:58,751
I was supposed to be the bridge,
not the fire starter,

371
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,987
but maybe that's how things
are won nowadays--

372
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:03,155
fear, leverage,

373
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:06,192
conversations and deals
behind the curtains. But you,

374
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:08,361
you made the choice,

375
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,962
so that makes you part of it.

376
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:14,601
And like it or not,
you are now the Mafia moll.

377
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,737
[laughs]

378
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:20,039
I beg your pardon?

379
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,174
Oh, you don't have to beg
anything from me, sweetheart.

380
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,643
Ever.

381
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:25,478
Just make sure you're ready
when the time comes

382
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,914
because-- win, lose or draw--
if this thing goes sideways,

383
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,716
it's not just my ass
they're after.

384
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,317
It's Dwight's and it's yours.

385
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:34,053
And although Dwight Manfredi
might be bulletproof,

386
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:37,624
I assure you, Margaret,
we are not.

387
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,091
Now smile.

388
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:43,362
Dr. Johnson.

389
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:45,532
Thank you so much for coming.
You remember Margaret?

390
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:47,700
-I do.
-Dr. Johnson,

391
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,135
-welcome.
-Thank you, Margaret.

392
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,803
[Thresher]
Come on in.

393
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:00,847
What the fuck?
Make the exchange.

394
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,915
Why is it taking so long?

395
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,920
Fuck it, let's go.

396
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:13,893
* tense, suspenseful music *

397
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:46,192
***

398
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,963
Motherfucker.

399
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,733
Manfredi!

400
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,135
* tense, suspenseful music *

401
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:15,722
[grunting]

402
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,335
What do you want to let me go?

403
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,539
Nothing.
You're not going anywhere.

404
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,376
You must want something.

405
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:41,548
I want everything you know.

406
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:47,219
Every fucking client
you ever worked with.

407
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,388
Every cell.

408
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:51,924
Everything.

409
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,293
Then I'll be killed.

410
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,162
So what?

411
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,077
[Cole] What'd you work out
with that man?

412
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,580
That man?

413
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,653
That son of a bitch
saw the light.

414
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,055
He saw through Dwight Manfredi,
straight on back

415
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:27,493
to his goat-fucking ancestors
in Sicily.

416
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,397
Now it's our time
to even the score.

417
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:34,567
Dwight Manfredi
was gonna bomb our house,

418
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,235
our home,

419
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:38,905
where you and your brother
were raised...

420
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,074
...and your mama passed.

421
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,176
He was gonna kill us both.

422
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:47,413
And then the Lord
redirected his hand.

423
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:49,849
How?

424
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:53,920
We'll kill several birds
with one righteous stone.

425
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,722
[grunts]

426
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:59,425
I'm gonna succeed
where you failed.

427
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:05,064
Some roaches won't be checking
out of their hotel tonight.

428
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,002
[electronic dance music playing]

429
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,622
[laughter]

430
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,463
Hey, look here.

431
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,131
So, every envelope,
we got to kick up, okay?

432
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,768
Boss got to get his cut. It's
just the cost of doing business.

433
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:43,435
I got it.
You sound like Goodie.

434
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:44,837
I'm just saying, you know?

435
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,172
Hey, but look,
business is booming over here.

436
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,206
I-I give you that.
I give it to you.

437
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,507
I give it to you. I see you.

438
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:50,176
-I see you.
-Tell me about it,

439
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,144
-we're almost out.
-Oh, yeah?

440
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:54,246
All right, I'm-a, I'm-a go get
some more over here,

441
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:55,948
and, you know,
we gonna do our thing.

442
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,984
Yo.
[laughs]

443
00:26:58,084 --> 00:26:59,551
A'ight, a'ight, a'ight.

444
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,105
What are you doing here, Cole?

445
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,607
-If Tyson sees you--
-I know.

446
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:24,944
I know. It's just...

447
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:27,847
...my father said something.

448
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:29,782
What?

449
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:33,552
He said something about hurting
people close to Manfredi.

450
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:37,690
And you're close to him, so...

451
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,092
Did he say any more?

452
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,163
Something about a hotel...

453
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:47,299
...and hurting a lot of people.

454
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:49,068
Stay here.

455
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:52,438
I will be right back.

456
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,515
Yeah, I can tell you crazy.

457
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:06,352
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the fuck?

458
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,720
Goddamn. Ow, ow!

459
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,555
Cole showed up.

460
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:11,891
You said what? That-that
motherfucker here right now?

461
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:14,927
Wait, listen, he said Dunmire's
planning something tonight.

462
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,262
Fuck that guy.
I don't give a fuck.

463
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:17,964
He said something about a hotel

464
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:20,399
and hurting a lot of people.

465
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:21,734
Hotel?

466
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,940
Oh, shit.

467
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,157
* tense, suspenseful music *

468
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:51,297
-Look at me.
-[groans]

469
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:54,666
Anything else
you want to remember?

470
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,469
-[Deacon mumbles]
-[Dwight] Think hard.

471
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,439
No. No.

472
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,109
-[Dwight] You got all that?
-Oh, I got it all on tape.

473
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:05,444
-We done here?
-Almost.

474
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:08,280
Remember this?

475
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,216
[grunts]

476
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:13,119
[Deacon groaning]

477
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,122
Now I'm done.
Get him out of here.

478
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:18,490
-[phone buzzing]
-With pleasure.

479
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:27,299
Fuck. Tyson, yeah. What's up?

480
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:28,500
What?

481
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,604
Fuck.

482
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:36,809
Musso!

483
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,310
Where the hell are you?

484
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,846
-Where's the target?
-[Dwight] The target?

485
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:41,447
It doesn't matter where
the fucking target is.

486
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:44,350
This maniac, this fucking Deacon
put a fucking bomb

487
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,485
at the Delmore Grand Hotel.

488
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:48,120
And how the fuck
do you know that?

489
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:50,689
How do I know?
I got him right in front of me.

490
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,291
You fucking speak up now.

491
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:53,725
Pull him up.

492
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:57,496
Tell him. Did you put a bomb
at the Grand Hotel?

493
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:58,464
Yeah.

494
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,666
-Yes? Louder!
-Yes.

495
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,601
[Dwight]
And what time?

496
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,837
-[Deacon laughs]
-What time?!

497
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:07,539
[gasps]
Ten.

498
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:09,341
[Dwight]
Speak up.

499
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,477
-Ten.
-You fucking hear that?

500
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:14,680
Now get over there!
I'm on my way.

501
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:23,755
[groans]

502
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:29,161
No! No!

503
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:31,097
[screaming]

504
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:37,003
[engine starts]

505
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:38,437
[Dwight]
Go!

506
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:44,410
[sirens wailing]

507
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:04,396
-[line ringing]
-Come on, Margaret, come on.

508
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:05,797
Fuck.

509
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:08,600
[phones buzzing, ringing]

510
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,610
Faith-based initiatives.
Traditional American values.

511
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,012
Those are the pillars
of my platform.

512
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,413
And I'm not just talking
about tradition.

513
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,882
I'm talking about protecting
the community.

514
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,717
Giving the people a voice
to stand up to the noise.

515
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:28,287
All good talking points,

516
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,889
which I've heard
from every candidate

517
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,458
in every election cycle.

518
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,895
What Mr. Thresher means is,

519
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:40,266
he's not just pledging support.

520
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:45,471
He's pledging
membership, tithes.

521
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,474
Absolutely.

522
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:51,610
Ten percent from a billionaire.

523
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,946
You could build
a hundred new sanctuaries,

524
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:55,614
a new church in every city.

525
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,985
Not just influencing policy
but leading it.

526
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:01,820
Dr. Johnson.

527
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:07,126
Faith is not a campaign promise.

528
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,129
It's a movement.

529
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:16,002
Conviction and commitment
are in short supply

I heard there was a...

589
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:28,854
a ruckus at that
wannabe governor's party.

590
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:35,261
Some people shouldn't be
where they shouldn't be.

591
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:40,098
I'm glad it worked out for you.

[Musso]
Well, what the fuck?

602
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,855
So what do you want to do?

603
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:12,791
Bury you. You broke our deal.

604
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:14,292
That's only in your mind.

605
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:16,362
No, no, no.
It doesn't work like that.

606
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:18,997
You fucked everything up.
Where is he?

607
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,868
Out of sight, out of mind.

608
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,670
What matters is still in here.

609
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,706
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you got
to share that with me.

610
00:38:28,674 --> 00:38:31,343
Maybe tomorrow.
It's been a long night.

611
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:34,513
I'm not going anywhere.

612
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:36,348
No, you're not.

613
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,718
