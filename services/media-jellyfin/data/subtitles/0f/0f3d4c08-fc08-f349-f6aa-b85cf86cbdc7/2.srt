00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,019
VOICE:
Previously on "Robin Hood."

2
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,062
[horse neighing]

3
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:24,859
[screaming]

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,360
I apologize
for my lateness.

5
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:28,154
I believe you arrived
just in time.

6
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,823
Mother, I come bearing gifts.

7
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,366
My Lord.

8
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:33,534
I did not know.

9
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,619
Maid Marian of Locksley,

10
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,580
you will swear
your fealty to me

11
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,915
and serve
as lady in waiting.

12
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,500
What brings you here,
my son?

13
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,544
Father's days are numbered.
It is my intention

14
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:45,171
that I take his place.

15
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,714
Blood does not make
a proper king.

16
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:47,757
My path is decided.

17
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:52,595
-And it will be the throne.
-John would defy anything

18
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,388
that doesn't serve John.

19
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,099
I must know his mind.
His methods.

20
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:59,935
-His endgame.
-How am I to do such a thing?

21
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,730
Make yourself visible.
Be a rose.

22
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:04,397
Not a lily.

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,275
EARL MARSHAL: I came to speak
with you about Priscilla.

24
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,611
I would like your permission
to court her.

25
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,030
Any hurt
done to her by you

26
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,200
shall be repaid
a thousand-fold.

27
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,286
Tell me what you know of
the forester Hugh of Locksley.

28
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:18,913
ROBIN: Aronne was
a horrible accident.

29
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,873
-It was all an accident.
-I-- I didn't mean for

30
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,874
any of this
to happen, Marian.

31
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,167
It doesn't matter
what you meant.

32
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:25,544
I never want
to see you again.

33
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,670
-ROBIN: I made a deal.
-JOHN: With who?

34
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,632
Eleanor, she wants
to stir the rebellion.

35
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,258
-To what end?
-To force the King

36
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,051
-to come here.
-And you get what?

37
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,512
She will release Marian
from her charge.

38
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,850
-[groans]
-[battle-cry]

39
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:42,228
Time to settle accounts.

40
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,896
I would kill you,
but leaving you

41
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,940
with no gold is
a far crueler fate.

42
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,900
SHERIFF: Robin Hood
has robbed Baron Warick.

43
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,069
I am holding you,
the leaders

44
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,905
of the Saxon community,
responsible.

45
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:55,908
You will be jailed
until Robin Hood comes forward,

46
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,285
and submits himself
to Norman justice.

47
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:13,843
ROBIN HOOD

48
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,443
Your presence is requested.

49
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,158
[keys jingling]

50
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:48,020
Robin Hood has once again
evaded justice.

51
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,732
I can only suspect
the Saxon people

52
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:52,816
have had a hand in it.

53
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,864
I have tried
reasoning with you.

54
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,743
Offering civility,
breaking bread.

55
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:05,871
Now it seems
a more direct approach

56
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,122
is in order.

57
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,086
So...

58
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,713
one of you will be freed

59
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,548
to deliver
Robin Hood a message.

60
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,635
If he does not surrender
by week's end,

61
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:21,971
the rest of you will hang

62
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,681
as traitors.

63
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:29,269
It is time Hood learned
the true price of his defiance.

64
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:35,651
[dramatic music]

65
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,405
If you value
the lives of the others,

66
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,115
you will get
my message to Hood.

67
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,497
You truly believe
Robin Hood will surrender?

68
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,709
I hope not.

69
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,003
If he did,
he'd ruin my plans.

70
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,048
[chuckling]

71
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,278
Feels different, doesn't it?

72
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,699
The air,
thicker with influence.

73
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,659
Sharper with ambition.

74
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,287
Is that what that smell is?

75
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,955
You're nervous.

76
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,334
You belong here, Priscilla.

77
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,170
You've always known
how to navigate any room

78
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,339
and turn it in your favor--
Westminster's no different.

79
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,966
Wilderness of its own,

80
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,177
complete with
predators and prey.

81
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,805
Sounds like
my kind of jungle.

82
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,360
[soft chatter]

83
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,572
So, I see he's brought
a pet from Nottingham.

84
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,574
I give her a week.

85
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,159
Perhaps less.

86
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,161
[soft chatter continues]

87
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,830
She won't last.

88
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,101
[soft music]

89
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,192
Soon...

90
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,944
all of Westminster
will be introduced

91
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,987
to Lady Priscilla
of Nottingham.

92
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,159
Marshal, it's beautiful.

93
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,207
You must be
properly adorned.

94
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,834
[sighing]

95
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,336
It feels good to be here.

96
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,964
Away from Nottingham.

97
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:05,092
Far away
from that devil Robin Hood.

98
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,400
What's the tide
bringing today?

99
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,655
A ship from the east.

100
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,803
[eerie music]

101
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,862
John.

102
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,614
It's been some time.

103
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,949
I was beginning
to think you died.

104
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:14,536
Not for lack of trying.

105
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,999
This is Tuck. Rob.

106
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,709
Rob?

107
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,461
Not Robin Hood?

108
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,672
Is this not the name
you were given?

109
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,342
Not by my father.

110
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,093
By my enemy.

111
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,179
Then it will be
the one that endures.

112
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:37,308
The name your enemy curses

113
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,561
is the one
history will write.

114
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,202
Ibrahim... Al-Rashid.

115
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,080
"Al-Rashid."

116
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,998
"The rightly-guided."

117
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,334
A name fitting
for a man with instincts,

118
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,544
a man such as myself.

119
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,880
Where did you learn Arabic?

120
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,799
Oh, I don't know it,
it's just that name,

121
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,884
it was from a book
my mother made me read.

122
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,427
She was a good mother then.

123
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,847
She was.

124
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,558
Word of your exploits
has reached London.

125
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,727
Stealing from Norman lords.

126
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,898
Infuriating Nottingham's
crusader... the Sheriff.

127
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,567
-It's impressive.
-I'm not here to be admired.

128
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,654
Do you have what we need?

129
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,282
[soft thump]

130
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,706
ROB: Steel.

131
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,083
We'll take these.

132
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,710
Those are more.

133
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,004
-How much more?
-Fifty ducats.

134
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,006
We didn't bring
that much gold to the city.

135
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,884
But we have more hidden.

136
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,761
I can have that brought to you
in the next week.

137
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,972
I don't know, John.

138
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,433
I have never failed to pay.

139
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,727
You never faced
what you are facing.

140
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,730
You're not taking on
drunken soldiers in a tavern.

141
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,940
You are challenging
the Sheriff,

142
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:10,277
and a man like that collects
his debts in blood.

143
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,279
I think you are going to die.

144
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:13,613
He won't die.

145
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,200
He's too big to die.
Look at him.

146
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,164
You ask much of me, Hood.

147
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,088
We will make good
on our debt.

148
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,008
And more than gold,
we'll owe you something greater.

149
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,968
What is that?

150
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,636
Loyalty.

151
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,227
[horse nickering]

152
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,646
TUCK: Something's changed.

153
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,398
A few nights ago,
your ambitions ended

154
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,025
at the borders
of Nottingham.

155
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,235
Now here we are in London,

156
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,363
making alliances with Saracens.

157
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,617
What aren't you telling me?

158
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,538
Time for ale.

159
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,207
It's a long ways back.

160
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,210
And we must be properly...
satiated.

161
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,212
[chuckling]

162
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,422
Not for me. You go on.

163
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,132
I have something
I need to do.

164
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:18,678
Come on.

165
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,403
IBRAHIM: I can get you
to the traitor's gate.

166
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,238
No further.

167
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,739
The woman you want,

168
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,783
her quarters are
in the east wing.

169
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,077
That's all I was told.

170
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,662
That's all I need.

171
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,482
MARIAN:
[echoing] Rob...

172
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,983
[echoing laughter]

173
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,560
Marian...

174
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,897
Rob... for pity's sake,

175
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,608
what are you doing here?
Leave!

176
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,401
I need you
to do something for me.

177
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,153
What are you talking about?

178
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,158
Deliver this to the Queen.

179
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,160
And tell her
it came from Robin Hood.

180
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:54,000
You dare speak that name
in front of me.

181
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,503
And you have the gall to ask
anything of me.

182
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,255
Leave, Rob, now.

183
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,383
I-- I will.

184
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,095
I only need you
to tell me one thing,

185
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,972
and that's
you don't love me.

186
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,983
You say it,
and you'll never see me again.

187
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,322
Love has nothing to do with it.

188
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:28,368
Love has everything
to do with it.

189
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,953
What else is there?

190
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,080
There's all the rest of it.

191
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,957
There's my brother,
he's dead!

192
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,751
And there are your lies!

193
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,716
The question is not
whether I love you or not.

194
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,511
The question is,
do I want to love you?

195
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,931
And the answer is no,
I don't.

196
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,149
[door slamming]

197
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,073
What's wrong with you,
Nottingham?

198
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,163
Nothing.

199
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,942
MARSHAL: Prince John seeks
an audience with the Pope?

200
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,070
Then he's after
papal endorsement.

201
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,822
It's a requirement
for any noble

202
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,491
who wants
to ascend the throne.

203
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,409
It won't be easy.

204
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,286
The path to His Holiness
is never straight.

205
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,080
It's a political dance.

206
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,748
He'll need to sit
with the cardinals first.

207
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,625
Navigate their ambitions

208
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,585
and egos just to get near
His Holiness,

209
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,295
and even then,

210
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,713
the Pope's blessing will
not come cheap.

211
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,176
-John doesn't have any funds.
-No.

212
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,303
But from what I understand,
he's seeking patrons.

213
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,138
[scoffing]

214
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,641
I still have
reliable agents in Rome?

215
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,559
You do.

216
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,353
Write to them and tell them
I want their full attention

217
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,980
-to this matter.
-And beyond that?

218
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,441
Nothing. We wait.

219
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,443
We set the board,
and then we make a move.

220
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,490
John's proving smarter
than I gave him credit for.

221
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,123
Well...

222
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,211
he is my son, after all.

223
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,642
[door closing]

224
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,240
[gentle music]

225
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,217
[birds chirping]

226
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,687
[horse hooves clopping]

227
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,278
[horse nickering]

228
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,738
Where is he?

229
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,824
-Who?
-Robin Hood.

230
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,870
Where do they hide?

231
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,373
Don't lie to me. I know
you foresters can find him.

232
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,551
-The palace suits you.
-Of course it does.

233
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,095
Have you seen
who I'm here with?

234
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,182
The measure of a woman
isn't whose arm she's on.

235
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,642
You told me that once.

236
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,769
Did I? Huh.

237
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,395
Well, that was
before said arm belonged

238
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,689
to the Earl Marshal
of Pembroke.

239
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,776
You're different with him.
In a good way.

240
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:32,195
He's like no other man
I've ever known.

241
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,447
He doesn't try to shrink me.

242
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,908
He doesn't want to.

243
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,077
You love him, don't you?

244
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,578
Yes.

245
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,165
I'm happy for you, Priscilla.

246
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,170
You're thinking
about Rob again, aren't you?

247
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,340
I would've thought you moved on
to something better by now.

248
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,259
Someone less impossible.

249
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,760
I'm trying.

250
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,096
It's just...

251
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,764
well, last night, I was
unavoidably reminded of him.

252
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,516
Marian!

253
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,226
What do you think
a life with Rob would look like?

254
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,355
You'd be hunted,
to the ends of the earth.

255
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,399
Is that your dream?

256
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,651
To ruin yourself for a man
who can't even save himself?

257
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,654
No, of course not.

258
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,408
Sweet Marian.

259
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:21,286
Nothing will change
what Rob has become.

260
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,247
The man you loved is gone,
beyond gone.

261
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,582
Condemned.

262
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,168
I know.

263
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,338
And I accept it.

264
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,051
[ominous music]

265
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,970
[door opening]

266
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,438
Elder Gamewell, Sire.

267
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,148
He has an entreaty to make.

268
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,693
Let us hear it then.

269
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,410
Hanging the others
will only stoke the fire

270
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,329
between Saxon and Norman.

271
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,165
If a man must die
for Rob's actions...

272
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,334
let it be me alone.

273
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,420
A selfless act, and admirable,
Gamewell, but...

274
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,215
ultimately meaningless.

275
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,885
The law must be upheld,

276
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,638
or this land would slide back
into the anarchy it once knew

277
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,432
before Norman rule
brought order.

278
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:27,060
What you call order, Sire,
is but a cudgel wielded

279
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,604
by the elite to strip Saxons
of their birthright.

280
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,606
[chuckling]

281
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,399
The same tired grievance.

282
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,443
Not tired.

283
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,445
True, Sire.

284
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,113
Levies that break
the backs of honest men.

285
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,034
Laws that serve
the privileged alone.

286
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,829
If a Saxon cannot pay,
he starves.

287
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,706
If he resists, he hangs.

288
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:56,005
You speak of justice, Gamewell.

289
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,049
Justice?

290
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,802
Was it justice
that hung Hugh Locksley?

291
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,804
I tried to help Locksley.

292
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,557
I offered him
a station of honor,

293
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,434
head forester,
he spat on it.

294
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,605
Defied the very law
he swore to serve.

295
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,941
-He knew the penalty.
-He was a good man.

296
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,153
[chuckling]

297
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,448
And yet one of your own
testified against him.

298
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,829
A Saxon?

299
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,081
Alwin, the forester.

300
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,835
It was his word
that condemned Hugh Locksley.

301
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,717
I didn't start
these troubles, Gamewell.

302
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:45,763
In fact, I did everything
in my power to prevent them.

303
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,225
I sought peace.

304
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,853
But my hand was forced.

305
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,481
So, here we are.

306
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,734
Robin Hood will pay
for his crimes,

307
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,028
just as his father did
before him.

308
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,071
The rope will tighten.

309
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,533
And the world will move on.

310
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,205
Except for anyone who gets
between myself and the boy.

311
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:20,882
I read you wrong, Marian.

312
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,218
I'd've thought
a woman of ambition

313
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,220
would prefer the courts of men
to the fields of God.

314
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:31,184
I prefer beauty,
wherever I find it.

315
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,144
Beauty is an interesting thing,
isn't it?

316
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,521
It requires
both patience and control.

317
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:36,898
Control?

318
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,943
Doesn't beauty flourish best
when left untamed?

319
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,987
Well, that depends.

320
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,490
Some things left to grow wild
become magnificent.

321
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,618
Others become weeds.

322
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,745
Perhaps that is the burden
of the gardener,

323
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,288
to know the difference.

324
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,084
Unfortunately, Your Highness,

325
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,211
today I feel
more a weed than flower.

326
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,296
Now that, Marian,
is the first thing

327
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,006
you've ever been wrong about.

328
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,841
[chuckling]

329
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:07,386
Hm, gardens here
should be grander.

330
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:08,679
Like at Fontainebleau,
have you been?

331
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,517
I'll take you someday.

332
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,685
That is,
if you stop disappearing.

333
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:18,397
-Disappearing?
-You always seem to find

334
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,358
a reason to slip
from my soirées,

335
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,944
just before
they get interesting.

336
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,987
Your mother's presence tends
to complicate matters.

337
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,658
Well, she won't always be here.

338
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:32,078
When she's gone,
much will change.

339
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,081
New rulers, new alliances.

340
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:39,669
Perhaps even
a new queen one day.

341
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:44,257
A new queen?

342
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,050
Who would dare wish
for such a thing?

343
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,095
It's not a wish, Marian.

344
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:51,430
It is an inevitability.

345
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:52,849
Time ends all things.

346
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,518
And all people.

347
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,648
Tell me, don't you ever wish
for something greater

348
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,732
than what you were given?

349
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,986
Sometimes, yes.

350
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,029
Of course you do.

351
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,615
A woman like you isn't
meant to simply exist.

352
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,119
She's meant to have...

353
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:15,371
whatever she wants.

354
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:18,457
And you shall, Maid Marian.

355
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:20,543
All you must do...

356
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,086
is speak it.

357
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:30,761
[soft music]

358
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,727
[horse neighing]

359
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,077
ELDER: A curse upon you.

360
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:00,208
Because of you,
good Saxons will hang,

361
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:01,959
your uncle among them.

362
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,214
What are you talking about?

363
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:11,135
Your uncle and four more,
the Sheriff took them.

364
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:14,013
Punishment for what you did
to Baron Warick.

365
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,017
And he'll hang them all,
unless you turn yourself in.

366
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,857
My uncle is guilty of nothing.

367
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,028
He did everything

368
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,988
to live by their customs.

369
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,282
He respected their laws,
he paid his taxes.

370
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,993
Sent his only son to court
and this is his repayment?

371
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:40,873
Betrayal... execution.

372
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,875
What if we bargain?

373
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,336
Offer them gold
for Gamewell's life?

374
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:47,755
Sheriff's a kingsman,
not a merchant.

375
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:50,675
What I'd do is return the gold
to Warick and hang him anyway.

376
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,887
Then I'll turn myself in.

377
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:57,265
No, you won't.

378
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,058
He'll make you watch the others
die and then kill you.

379
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:00,851
He's out to make a point.

380
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,813
ROBIN:
There's no way around it.

381
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,733
We will ride to Nottingham
to free them.

382
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:11,696
Mm, a fight,
a language I understand.

383
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,657
Assaulting
a Norman castle is suicide.

384
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:16,701
We've done it before
and we're all still here.

385
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,619
They didn't know
we were coming then.

386
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:21,539
Well, what do you suggest, Tuck?
We just leave them to die?

387
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,666
No, no, that's not
what I'm suggesting.

388
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,710
But if you go head-on...

389
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,169
you will all die.

390
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,505
You, your uncle, everyone.

391
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:31,632
And you know
another way, hm?

392
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,843
Saxons built that castle.

393
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,387
I bet that castle holds secrets.

394
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,265
It does. First day
I was locked up,

395
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:41,767
I shared a wall
with a stonemason.

396
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:45,313
He kept on about escaping
through a sally port.

397
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,939
What's that?

398
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,399
It was a bit
of a secret entrance,

399
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,192
as I understand it.

400
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,320
Built for slipping out
during a siege.

401
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,780
He's right. Lightly tucked
along the eastern wall,

402
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,449
closest to the tree line.

403
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,243
If the Sheriff was ever to run,
that's where he'd go.

404
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,162
Even if we get in,

405
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,122
we'd still be blind.

406
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,165
MILANGE: No.

407
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,711
I know every passage.

408
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:11,047
Every stairwell.
The halls for servants.

409
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,467
I can lead us through.

410
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,760
You sure?

411
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,679
I'm sure.

412
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,723
Then we go.

413
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:22,683
At night, in and out.

414
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,561
Before the Sheriff realizes
his cage is empty.

415
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:29,148
[dramatic crescendo]

416
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,108
[birds chirping]

417
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,826
Hiding?

418
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,328
No, thinking.

419
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,415
I missed you.

420
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,043
While you were gone.

421
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,882
You kissed me.

422
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:56,967
Did you like it?

423
00:27:58,511 --> 00:27:59,929
I did.

424
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,849
Then why did you stop?

425
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,644
Why didn't you take me to bed?

426
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,898
It wouldn't've been right.

427
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:13,818
Why?

428
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:22,701
You still love her.

429
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,798
I can make you forget her.

430
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:41,470
Let me.

431
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,641
[gentle music]

432
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,327
No more being noble.

433
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:09,206
We could die tonight.

434
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,292
But if we don't,

435
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,002
you will take me to bed.

436
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,756
[gentle music]

437
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,027
CELENE: You look as though
you've taken a wrong turn.

438
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,575
A little far from Nottingham,
I suppose.

439
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,786
I'm looking for the east wing.

440
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,330
Earl Marshal's chambers.

441
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,540
The east wing?

442
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,669
I think you'd be
more at home in the south.

443
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,380
-The south?
-The servants' quarters.

444
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,509
You...

445
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,135
must be Celene de Fitzou,

446
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:05,554
servant to the Queen.

447
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:08,432
Always at Eleanor's heels,
as I hear.

448
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,684
From Nottingham,
you hear much.

449
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:14,104
I suppose gossip travels quickly
in such small circles.

450
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,608
Oh, I don't gossip.
I listen.

451
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,069
It's how I decipher
the meaningful

452
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,529
from the meaningless.

453
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,781
And yet, it seems,

454
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,367
you still haven't
found your way.

455
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,160
Perhaps you've been listening
to the wrong people.

456
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:30,579
Perhaps you speak

457
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:33,457
with more confidence
than knowledge.

458
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:35,751
A common flaw
amongst those that serve.

459
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,261
Do enjoy your stay,
Lady Priscilla.

460
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,513
You'll find
where you belong eventually.

461
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:49,306
The palace has
a way of sorting people

462
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,100
into their proper place.

463
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:59,066
[bugs chirping]

464
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,734
[walking stick thumping]

465
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,780
Priests say...

466
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:08,617
rushing wind
is the breath of God.

467
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:11,745
Ah, well,
Saxons say it's the wind.

468
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,247
[Tuck chuckles]

469
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,418
You're troubled.

470
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:18,961
We do what must be done.

471
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:22,047
Still, it will be difficult.

472
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,133
Mm, yes.

473
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,677
Assaulting a Norman castle
is a bold attack.

474
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:30,180
So bold, in fact,
it may even

475
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,057
reach the ears
of the King in France.

476
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,851
You've been speaking
to Little John?

477
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,478
Only because you are
keeping something from me.

478
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,564
That wasn't hard to see.

479
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,110
You're leading them all
toward danger.

480
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,779
Perhaps death.

481
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,281
Do you know why?

482
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:48,991
To save our elders.

483
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:50,826
My uncle amongst them.

484
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,703
You want to keep
your bargain with the Queen?

485
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,455
This has nothing
to do with that.

486
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,498
Are you so sure?

487
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,710
Of all the lies
a man can tell,

488
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:02,087
none more dangerous
than the ones he tells himself.

489
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,884
You're complicating it, Tuck.

490
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,386
I fight tonight
because someone has to.

491
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,472
If not, innocent men will die.

492
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,642
Everybody's ready, Rob.

493
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:26,111
[Rob sighing]

494
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,280
We move fast, quiet,

495
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,324
we don't stop
until our people are free.

496
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,952
Let's go kill some Normans.

497
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,669
And save some Saxons too,
God willing.

498
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,967
[suspenseful music]

499
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,060
[whispering]
Guard, guard, guard, guard...

500
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,321
Are you sure
you can find it?

501
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:10,864
I already have.

502
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,494
All right, you make
your way to the stables

503
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,871
and loose the horses.
To the dungeons, Milange.

504
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,500
Uh, Rob...

505
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,168
don't die.

506
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:48,861
[suspenseful music]

507
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,084
[groaning]

508
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:05,461
[distant thud]

509
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:10,466
-To the right.
-Rob!

510
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:11,800
Uncle!

511
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,719
You shouldn't have come.

512
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:16,889
But then who would keep you
from the noose, old man?

513
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,306
Rob.

514
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,270
Bless you, my boy.

515
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:25,063
All right, all right.

516
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,774
We've bought ourselves
minutes, not hours,

517
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,442
-so let's not waste them.
-This way.

518
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:36,283
[suspenseful music]

519
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,534
-Their guard--
-We can go through this way.

520
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,878
-Straight across.
-What?

521
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,797
-Everyone in.
-Get the elders.

522
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,632
[soft overlapping chatter]

523
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,967
Get across, straight across,
straight across there.

524
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,805
[grunting]

525
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,274
Robin Hood, I presume.

526
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:15,364
Did you really think you could
slip in here so easily?

527
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:18,283
I suppose I did.

528
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:21,286
At best, you're half the man
your father was.

529
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:23,872
Still just a boy.

530
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:25,332
John.

531
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,502
Get everyone out the front,
I'll distract the Sheriff.

532
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,548
Kill them.

533
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:35,676
Now.

534
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,638
[grunting]

535
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,732
[battle-cry]

536
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,655
[battle-cry]

537
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,116
[groaning]

538
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,662
[battle-cries]

539
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,839
Henry, get out!

[grunting]

542
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,517
They're coming!

00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,977
[groaning, gurgling]

544
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:28,604
No, no,
no, no, no, no...

545
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,231
-No-no-no-no.
-No, go.

546
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:33,734
[groaning, gurgling]

547
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,527
-Go!

[soft music]

549
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:56,465
SHERIFF: Locksley!

550
00:36:58,258 --> 00:36:59,551
Locksley!

551
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:05,098
[tense music]

552
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,143
[battle cry]

[John screaming]

00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:53,939
[all screaming]

559
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,149
[battle-cries]

560
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,076
Okay, horses.

561
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,794
[grunts]

562
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,634
This doesn't count as stealing.

563
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:34,563
[dramatic music]

564
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,911
Where did you think
you could run?

565
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,750
I'm not running, Sheriff.

566
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:58,920
I came for you.

567
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,395
[hollering]

568
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,565

-[screaming]
-Hurry up, men!

572
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:42,130
It's over, Locksley.

573
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,925
Do what your father could not.

574
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,510
Admit your crimes.

575
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,136
Pay the penalty.

576
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:52,307
Not today!

577
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,607
Then you'll die
like your father did,

578
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:03,360
alone, beaten,
already forgotten.

579
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:16,623
SOLDIER:
Get after him!

580
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:17,833
-We jump!
-What?!

581
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,877
[hollering]

582
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:26,091
[screaming]

583
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,845
Ready?

584
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:37,727
Rob! Get on!

585
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,690
Uncle, get on!

586
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,819
-John!
-TUCK: Quickly, quickly!

587
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,698
TUCK:
We need to go now!

588
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,616
-[Ralph grunts]
-Get on!

589
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,535
-Get on! Get on!
-No! No!

590
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:55,162
-Go, Tuck, go!
-We can't leave Henry.

591
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,581
Go!

592
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:04,462
[tense music]

593
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,217
[horse neighing]

594
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:21,062
[Sheriff exhaling]

595
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,484
No sign of them.

596
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,779
They vanished into the forest
like spirits.

597
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,698
Unfortunate.

598
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:37,162
It would have been cleaner
had Hood died here.

599
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,414
And the others?

600
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:41,958
The outlaws freed them.

601
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,628
-All of them?
-Every last one.

602
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,254
Good.

603
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:51,092
I now have eyes and ears
in Robin Hood's camp.

604
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:53,553
[chuckling]

605
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,555
[soft chatter]

606
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:58,558
A finer theater
than Nottingham, isn't it?

607
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,228
And yet I find all the players
much the same.

608
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,230
What do you make of them?

609
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,233
Small.

610
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:09,319
Then I suppose it's only fair
you remind them of their place.

611
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,906
And how would one do that,
My Lord?

612
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,036
You are Lady Priscilla
of Nottingham.

613
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:19,579
Mm-hm.

614
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:21,456
Daughter
of the Sheriff of Nottingham.

615
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:23,917
Goddaughter to the King.

616
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:26,378
And you're on the arm
of the Earl Marshal of Pembroke.

617
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,839
Let them see you.

618
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,141
[fire crackling]

619
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:50,860
Mud... and worms.

620
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:54,114
No memory, no meaning.

621
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:58,702
Just dead and gone.

622
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:01,705
ROB: He didn't die
for nothing, Ralph.

623
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,581
He died fighting
for something that matters.

624
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,460
We shouldn't have
left him behind.

625
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:12,465
ROB: We had to.

626
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,136
This isn't a farewell.

627
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,931
This isn't honoring Henry.

628
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,349
This is pageantry.

629
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:25,228
Smoke and ceremony.

630
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:31,693
I know
how you feel now, Rob.

631
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,281
I see it now.

632
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:40,577
I see why you are
the way you are.

633
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:45,206
And I want what you want.

634
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,171
I want blood.

635
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,883
[dramatic music]

636
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:06,269
[ominous music]

637
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:12,275
[claps]

638
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:14,736
His Lordship,
Earl Marshal of Pembroke,

639
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:16,613
and Lady Priscilla
of Nottingham

640
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,491
will now perform
the Lovers' Dance.

641
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:22,869
[gentle melody]

642
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:37,092
[music continues]

643
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:07,080
[tempo rises]

644
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,759
[clearing throat]

645
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:21,469
[soft chuckle]

646
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:26,224
Standing on the edge of life
doesn't suit you, Marian.

647
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:27,976
[soft chuckling]

648
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:31,604
Come, dance with me.

649
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,442
[scoffs]

650
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,068
Surely there are
others here

651
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,695
more deserving
of Your Grace's attention.

652
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,531
Yet I stand before you,
not them.

653
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,956
[applause]

654
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,505
If a prince asks me to dance,

655
00:45:57,547 --> 00:45:59,215
who am I to refuse?

656
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,550
[soft chuckle]

657
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:07,765
ELEANOR:
"All your victories abroad

658
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:09,809
will count for nothing

659
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:11,603
if you tarry any longer.

660
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:13,521
England waits.

661
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:18,067
But your enemies do not
wait idly.

662
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,322
The crown isn't
merely worn, Richard,

663
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:26,493
it must be guarded
and defended.

664
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:31,289
In your absence, lesser men
set their eyes upon it.

665
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:34,501
Even now, there are those
whispering your name less

666
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,252
and John's more.

667
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:41,132
You must return.

668
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:43,301
If you don't...

669
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:45,178
you'll find yourself
king of nothing

670
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,972
but distant memories
and hollow victories.

671
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:55,146
I remain Eleanor,

672
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:57,398
Queen of England,
by the grace of God."

673
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:05,406
[dramatic music]

674
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,877
-[wincing]
-I told you it would sting.

675
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:20,922
You'll have to live with it
for a while until it heals.

676
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:23,007
I've lived with worse.

677
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:24,592
[chuckle]

678
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:28,972
I was wrong.

679
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:32,183
You've built something here.

680
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:35,520
A home, a cause.

681
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:38,690
A place where Saxons
and those cast aside

682
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,817
can stand together.

683
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,361
When I told you to leave,
I didn't understand that.

684
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:44,946
Now I do.

685
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:52,954
There's something else.

686
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,378
The Sheriff spoke to me
of your father's death.

687
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:05,383
Told me a heinous truth.

688
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:10,388
It was a Saxon
who betrayed him.

689
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,433
A Saxon.

690
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:19,063
Who?

691
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:23,818
Alwin.

692
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,708
You were in the castle the night
my father was condemned.

693
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:41,711
-Yes.
-Who was there?

694
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,505
Um, just...

695
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:49,469
the Sheriff, the Bishop,

696
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,012
Earl Huntingdon...

697
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,474
and another man.

698
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:57,644
A forester, I think.

699
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,189
-He had a hood.
-Was he tall?

700
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,067
-Red of hair?
-Yes.

You, take her!

ALWIN: No! No!

709
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:05,211
No, Rob, no! No! Stop!

710
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,091
[groaning]

711
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:11,718
He's gone mad, help me!

712
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,136
Rob, what are you doing?

713
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,721
He's gone mad, help--

714
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:19,934
This man conspired
against my father

715
00:50:19,976 --> 00:50:21,018
with the Sheriff
of Nottingham.

716
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:25,148
He betrayed him
to the death,

717
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:28,317
and now he will receive
his just rewards.

718
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,862
-Wait, Rob, please--
-Deny it!

719
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,490
I didn't mean for it
to happen!

720
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:35,533
I didn't know
he would be hanged!

721
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:38,411
How was I to know?

722
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,291
The Normans...

723
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,960
they poison men like you...

724
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:47,795
to turn
against your own,

725
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:50,089
to protect their thrones,

726
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:51,924
their power, their gold.

727
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,720
You let them.

728
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:00,850
You turned on us all.

729
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,981
Robert.

730
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:23,915
[soft music]

731
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,570
[coughing, gasping]

732
00:51:56,656 --> 00:51:57,865
[thud]

733
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,621
[ominous music]

734
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:13,214
ROB:
He did this to himself.

735
00:52:16,676 --> 00:52:18,261
This is what betrayal earns.

736
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:24,433
[mournful music]

737
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,023
[ethereal whispers]

738
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,451
[dramatic music]
